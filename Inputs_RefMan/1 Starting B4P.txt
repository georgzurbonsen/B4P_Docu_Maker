	Please refer to __Installation and Setup__ section in the User's Guide which summarizes installing B4P run-time machine and the different ways how to start them up.
	This section will elaborate more on the starting behavior of the B4P run-time machine and how __command line switches__ influence this staring behavior.

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	Following command line switches (or options)influence B4P startup behavior. These options are not added to the global variable array <b>command line arguments[]</b>, and they
	will not be visible in any other variable or parameter inside the running B4P program..

	=== 100, 900, bold_column_1
	Swtich	| Description
	-d	| Normally, at start-up, B4P sets the working directory to the directory where the B4P program to execute is located. <br>\
		  This command line switch suppresses this and leaves the current dierctory where B4P has been started.
	-i	| Start B4P and enter __interactive mode__ immediately.  Even if a B4P program has been specified, the program will not be loaded and started</b>.
	-I	| MacOS / Linux only: Starty B4P in installation mode where the welcoming text and loading library files are skipped.  Not recommended for normal applicaction use.
	-w	| Suppress B4P welcome text. <br>\
		  <u>Attention 1:</u> Also the license info text (e.g. demo mode only if no valid license exists) will be hidden.<br>\
		  <u>Attention 2:</u> The B4P initialization program "B4P Init.b4p" will not be started.  This file would otherwise load the default important B4P library files (e.g. "Support Library").<br>\
		  The system variable <b>runtime settings[verbose]</b> is set to <b>quiet</b>. This feature is useful for batch scripts which shall run fast and not outputting unnecessary text.
	-q	| Starts the B4P program with runtime <b>settings[verbose]= quiet</b> to suppress any unnecessary output.<br>\
		  To suppress the welcome text, too, use teh command lie swtich -w, too.
	-x	| Skip the "<i>Press [Enter] to end the program</i>" before B4P is exiting.  Useful for running B4P programs from batch scripts without user interaction
	===

	Invalid command line parameters will provide descriptive error messages and stop B4P.<br><br>
	Command line arguments may be freely ordered and specified as combined or individual parameters.  See the example below.

"Starting Behavior":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Starting Behavior" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The B4P run-time machine undertakes a few steps before the specified B4P is started up.  The flow chart shown below illustrates this.
	Start-up begins with a common initialzation procedure, beginnign with identifying __command line switches__ if they are provided, and then
	show a welcome-text (if not disabled with <b>-q</b> or <b>-w</b>), initialize all system variables and retrieve the locale settings from <b>B4P Locale Settings.json</b>
	located in the application data directory.  The locale settings has originally been selected during installation, and the function __set locale(__) 
	is available to change tem without new installation.

	<br><br>

	A decision point follows the initial sequence which does either branch right to load a specified B4P Program file, or to the left if no such file has been
	specified, or straight down to enter interactive mode, e.g. with the __command line switch__ <b>-i</b>.  On the left-hand path, B4P looks for 'main.b4p' in the
	current directory and then in the memmorized starting directory.  On the right-and path, B4P opens the specified program file.
	In all three cases, unless if the command line switch <b>-w</b> is applied, the <b>B4P Init.b4p</b> initialization program in the library directory will be called to
	carry out some initial preparations which include:

	* "Utility Library": A collection of supplementary B4P functions
	* "Zip Library": File compression and decompression
	* "Office Library": Ability to access Microsoft office meta data and load Excel files
	* "Support Library": Comprehensive help and support features

	The intialization prgraom <b>B4P Init.b4p</b> will also call <b>My B4P Init.b4p</b>, a user customizable initialization program twice (before and after including
	the library files), as long the file is available in the user application directory.  For more details, see the section on __user initialization program__


	Once this has happend, then the laoded B4P program will be started or interactive mode is activated, depending on the parameters provided.

"User Initialization Program" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "User initialization program" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "custom initialization program","My B4P Init" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	If a file called <b>My B4P Init.b4p</b> is avaiable in the directory for user application data, then it will be loadeod executed:
	The directory name is specified in the system variable <b>system info[user app data directory b4p]</b> and is typically
	* <b>Windows:</b> C:\users\Your User Name\AppData\Local\b4p
	* <b>Linux/MacOS:</b> /home/username/.profile/b4p/
	
	This file will be executed twice, namely before the library files are loaded, and after this.  For this reason, the template code prepared
	in this file makes use of the __once(__) {...} __else__ {...} clause where the first code block after <b>once</b> is executed at the first
	instance, and the code block after <b>else</b> is executed at the 2nd instance.

	<br><br>

	The factory contents of this file <b>My B4P Init.b4p</b> contains the following simple contents:  Silencing output messages while loading
	the libraries by setting <b>system info[verbose]</b> to <b>quiet</b>, and in the 2nd call back to <b>low</b> to allow minimum messages
	and progress information to occur. See __verbose__ for more information about this.

	+++,
    "Examples 01:"::
once // Following code is executed at the 1st call before loading library files begins
{

//	echo("Starting to load the standard library files ...");
	runtime settings[verbose] = quiet;

}
else // Following code is executed at the 2nd call after all library files have been loaded
{

//	echo("... Done.");
	runtime settings[verbose] = low;

"Licensing" :

    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "licensing" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "licensing","unlock" ],
    "Description 01:Licensing Scheme"::

	Without possessing a license, B4P will start in a demo mode and exploit the full performance.  The demo mode is useful for evaluations,
	demo, education and doing small projects.  However, following restrictions apply:

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Table size restrictions when saving	| Tables can only be saved if the table contains not more than 300 rows and not more than 40 columns.
	Number of savings 			| During a running B4P session, at most 5 tables can be saved.  The number of tables (and not files) also applies when using the procedure <b>table save multiple</b> to save two or more tables in one file.
	===

	Table size restrictions do not apply while processing tables internally, i.e. you are able to load large amounts of data and do data processing and
	analysis, but need to condense your output accordingly inorder to meet the size limitations.
	<br/><br/>
	Individual licenses for one machine, a specific domain or site licenses will be provided on request.
