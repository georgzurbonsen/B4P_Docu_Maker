	Beyond4P supports standard procedures which are in fact used to defined user-specific procedures and functions. 
	Procedures are defined as functions which do not provide a return value and must be called as a procedure.
	Functions are defined to always provide return values and must be called as functions where the return value must be used further.
	A combination of both is allowed which provides flexibility to use defined code either as a procedure or function.

	Additional function names may be defined for the same user code.  In this case, the local variable <b>function name[]</b> will be
	available to identify the function name used.

	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Name of local variable | Description
	function name[] | Name of called function.  This is insofar useful if __additional function names__ have been defined for the same code
	<i>parameter name</i>[] | Name of parameter provided.  Example: <b>hello[]</b> is defined if one of the parameters is called <b>hello</b>.
	parameter <i>n</i>[] | Numbered parameter provided.  If the number of parameter is not limited, then all remaining parameters are numbered, with 1 as 1st parameter.
	parameter count[] | Contains the number of parameters passed.  This is useful if the defined function allows for flexibility regarding number of parameters passed.

	* C:/Program Files\Beyond4P.exe
	* \usr\local/bin\Beyond4P

	alphabetic down ignore case	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore blanks	| Same as alphabetic. Blanks (incl. new line, tabs, space) are ignored.  'St. Moritz' and 'St.Moritz' are equivalent.
	alphabetic down ignore blanks	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore both		| Same as alphabetic, ignoring both case and blanks
	alphabetic down ignore both	| Opposite direction of above
	numeric				| Sorts by numbers.  Non-numeric contents are interpreted like zero.  Smallest number comes first.
	numeric down			| Opposite direction of above
	date				| Sorts by dates.  Fields containing no qualified dates are interpreted like blank dates.  See rules below the table.
	===

	Rules on literals:
	* Blank literal '' comes first
	* One space symbol ' ' (UNICODE 32) comes next.
	* Sorting is done based on UNICODE character codes.
	* Sorting takes no cultural implications into consideration (e.g. Spanish: LL follows L).
	* Numbers are also treated as literals: 0100 comes before 10.

	Rules on numerals:
	* For contents beginning a number: The 1st number will be recognized.
	* For contents beginning with non-numeric symbols: Interpreted as zero.

	Rules on dates:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* If year is missing, current year is assumed.
	* If day is missing, the 1st day of month is assumed.
	* Month names in key languages like "Jan", "feb", "März", "avril", "May", "juni", etc. are recognized as months and sorted accordingly.
	* Local settings are used as rules to resolve country dependent date formats like 01/02/2015 (day and month ordering: 2. Jan 2015 or 1. Feb 2015).  Local settings are in the system variables and can be changed.
	* Time values in the date are ignored.  E.g. "14.07.2016 10:00" and "14.07.2016 11:00" are treated as identical values

	Rules on dates and times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values without time come before date values with time (e.g. "00:00:00") if date are on the same day.
	* Time values are not ignored

	Rules on times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values are ignored.  "14.07.2016 10:00” and “15.07.2016 10:00” are treated as identical values

	Consolidation Action		| Description
	none				| No consolidation: The destination fields will not be overwritten.<br>At the end of the consolidation run, the destination field contains the data from the first row belonging to the group.
	overwrite			| Source field overwrites destination field. <br>At the end of the consolidation run, the destination field contains the data from the last row belonging to the group.
	overwrite if blank		| Source field overwrites destination field if the destination field is still blank. See <sup>1</sup>
	overwrite except blank		| Source field overwrites destination field if the soruce field is not blank. See <sup>1</sup>
	blank				| Destination field will be blanked.  Useful to void contents no longer needed after consolidation.
	zero				| Destination field will be set to 0. Useful to void contents no longer needed after consolidation.
	delete				| This column will be deleted after the consolidation run.  Useful to get rid of contents no longer needed.
	append				| Append string contents from source fields to destination fields.  A separator string will be inserted if available.
	append once			| Like above, but contents are only appended if not yet found in the destination string.
	must match			| Checks source and destination fields.  If they differ, then <b>(Inconsistent)</b> will be written.
	blank if different		| Checks source and destination fields.  If they differ, then the destination fields will be blanked.
	min abc				| Choose the entry in the lower alphabetc sorting order (e.g. abc preferred over def). Blanks have highest priority. 
	min abc ignore blanks		| Choose the entry in the lower alphabetc sorting order (e.g. abc preferred over def). Blanks have lowest priority. See <sup>1</sup>
	max abc				| Choose the entry in the higher alphabetc sorting order (e.g. def preferred over abc). Blanks have lowest priority.
	min				| Choose the entry with the smaller value. Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	min ignore blanks		| Choose the entry with the smaller value. Blanks have lowest priority. Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	min ignore zero			| Choose the entry with the smaller value.  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero have lowest priority. See <sup>2</sup>
	max				| Choose the entry with the greater value. Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	max ignore blanks		| Choose the entry with the greater value. Blanks have lowest priority. Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	max ignore zero			| Choose the entry with the greater value.  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero have lowest priority. See <sup>2</sup>
	sum				| Calculates the sum: Adds source fields to destination fields.
	sum blank if zero		| Calculates the sum: Adds source fields to destination fields. If destination field is 0, it will be set to blank.
	product				| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.  Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	product ignore blanks		| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.  Blanks are ignore, but non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	product ignore zero		| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.    Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero are ignored.  See <sup>2</sup>
	average				| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated). Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	average ignore blanks		| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated). Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	average ignore zero		| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated).  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero are ignored. See <sup>2</sup>
	count				| Count all fields.  Is always 1 or bigger.
	count ignore blanks		| Count non-blank fields only. See <sup>1</sup>
	count ignore zero		| Count non-zero fields. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count positive			| Count if value is > 0. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count positive or zero		| Count if value is >= 0.  Blanks and non-numerals are treated as 0 and will be counted.
	count negative			| Count if value is < 0. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count negative or zero		| Count if value is <= 0.  Blanks and non-numerals are treated as 0 and will be counted.
	===

	<sup>1</sup> Fields are considered blank if they are absolutely blank, i.e. containing zero characters.  Fields containing white spaces (spaces, tabs, new lines, etc.) are not considered blank.<br>
	<sup>2</sup> If none of the fields qualify for calculation (e.g. min ignore blanks where all fields are blank), then the result will be zero.
