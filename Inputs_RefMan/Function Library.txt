	The functions described next cover the art of combining two (or more) tables using the fine arts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra" target="_blank">relational algebra</a>
	where different algebraic rules can be applied to rows and columns.

	<br><br>

	In a simple example, two tables with members of two clubs (e.g. tennis and squash) need to be merged into one where the last and first names of the
	members shall act as matching identifiers.  In case no person has a membership in both clubs, no overlap applies, and the list will simply be
	appended where the data are aligned to the right columns, using header names as orientation.  The columns in both tables do not need to be aligned
	before the merger.  If one or more persons possess memberships in both clubs, then the information will be consolidated where the same 
	__ consolidation actions__ rules are available as used by __table consolidate__.  As an example, the account receivable (e.g.
	indoor court reservation fees to be balanced) can be added up whereas the preferences at the club bar can be consolidated with <b>append once</b>
	so the preference for tonic water at one club and beer at the other club will appended into "tonic water, beer".

	<br><br>

	If no identifier columns are defined in the functions described next, then every row will be considered unique.  Merging the table is treated appending two tables,
	with aligning the data into the right columns.	 

	<br><br>

	The following table summarizes the 25 functions in a 5 x 5 matrix with specifc rules to be applied on rows as wll as columns.
	The table contains illustrations on how the rows are combined (shades of red / orange / yellow) and how columns are combined (shades of
	gray and light blue).  The syntax of the function name does first describe the operation on the rows (e.g. __table merge__) followed by
	the operation on the columns (e.g. __table merge extend columns(__)).  If no extension like <b>... extend columns</b> is specified, then
	no additional columns are added in the target table and the data in the source table not fitting in the target table structure will not be taken over.

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	A new powerful B4P feature, consisting of three functions, is to identify, select and extract one or more sub-tables located inside a table.
	This becomes very useful when dealing with sophisticated tables created by external sources where you cannot advise them how to
	structure the data so you can use them easily.  Following three functions need to be called in sequence:

	__table explore(__): This function identifies all sub-tables inside a table where a few criteria settings are available to identify tables and keep them 
	separate from other contents, e.g. title texts.
	<br><br>
	This function returns a parameter set containing 0, 1 or more coordinates for every sub-table found.
	The sub-tables beginning on the same row must contain a spacing of 1 column.  Direct neighboring is possible if the next table begins at a different tow (Illustration: See sub-table 2 and 3).
	<br><br>
	__table filter(__): The collection of coordinates can be narrowed down by matching header contents with given patterns and specifying minimum 
	table widths and heights.  This function also returns the same kind of parameter set, but probably with fewer coordinates.
	<br><br>
	__table extract(__): This final function will extract a selected sub-table based on the coordinates and sub-table chosen.  
	Tables can be extracted either into new blank tables or added to existing tables, allowing to arrange them horizontally and/or vertically.

	text strings (literals) and vice versa in JavaScriopt Object Notation (JSON).  Focus is given on full data preservation in round trip cases, 
	i.e. data is saved as JSON and covered again, and vice versa.

	<br><br>

	Following rules will be applied when saving variables into JSON text. 
	These rules are insofar important because the Beyond4P can consist of both base variables, array and structure members and sub-members, 
	and the simple JSON representation focuses on leaf data, meaning the final members and sub-members without the intermediate one.  
	In addition, special rules are applied to save Beyond4P specific formats such as dates (and times) and parameter sets.

	Following special rules apply
	=== 200, 800, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	General			| The base variable as well as all members and sub-members, regardless if array or structures, will be saved.
	__Simple Variables__	| If the variable is a simple variable, then it will be saved as a JSON plain array containing 1 element.  Using 'JSON B4P' option in the loading process will recover the variable properly.
	__Arrays__		| B4P arrays are stored as JSON arrays
	__Structures__		| B4P structures are stored as JSON objects
	Literals		| Literal string contents are stored as text in double quotation marks
	Numerals		| Numerals are written as numbers without quotation marks.  When saving, scientific notation is not used.  However, JSON files containing scientific notation will be loaded correctly.
	Booleans		| Will be written as <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.  B4P will recognize boolean values and convert them to Boolean type
	Void values		| Are written as <b>null</b> in JSON output.
	Dates			| Dates (and times) are written as text in following formats: "YYYY-MM-DD", "hh:mm:ss", "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss", and "0000-00-00".  The last value refers to a blank date and will be recognized as such. When reading JSON data, dates and times must adhere strictly with the given formats, otherwise they will be loaded as text (e.g. "01 April 2020").
	Parameter Sets		| Parameter sets will be converted to string format (similarly implemented as in the __literal(__) function) and stored as text.  Literals are stored in single qutoation marks, aiming to avoid confusion wtih double quotation marks for JSON text contents.  Example: "{1,true,'Abc'}".  Nested parameter sets are supported.
	Loading literals	| All loaded literals are declared as <b>quoted literals</b>
	Special characters	| Specific characters will be converted to JSON-compliant escape sequences, e.g. new line, quotation marks inside literals, etc.

    "Description 02:Intermediate Nodes"::
	The JSON model describes a tree containing data at the end nodes only (leaves) whereas B4P variable model also supports data in intermediate
	nodes as well.  In these case, intermediate arrays containing 2 elements are introduced to describe the intermediate node followed by the 
	remaining data up the data tree.  See the program example below:
    "Examples 02:JSON code without and with intermediate nodes"::
	b[Red] = Rot;
	b[Green,light] = HellgrÃ¼n;
	b[Green,dark] = DunkelgrÃ¼n;
	b[Blue,light] = Hellblau;
	b[Blue,dark] = Dunkelblau;

	inspect(b[]);

	j[] = variable to json( b[], JSON);

	echo("JSON code:", new line, j[], new line, "_______" );

	json to variable( c[], j[], JSON B4P );
	inspect( c[] );

	echo(new line, "Add data to intermediate nodes");

	b[] = Colors;
	b[Green] = Shades of green;

	j[] = variable to json( b[], JSON);

	echo("JSON code:", new line, j[], new line, "_______" );

	json to variable( c[], j[], JSON B4P );
	inspect( c[] ); // Same as before.

"Resident Attributes Functions":
  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Resident attributes functions" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	Resident attributes are values which can be stored in dedicated files.  In contrast to loading and saving variables, attributes are tuples
	consisting of <i>attribute names</i> and <i>attribute values</i>.  Values can take any type, e.g. numeral, literal, date, Boolean and parameter set.
	Attribute names can be either flat (just one name) or hierarchical (parameter set containing multiple names representng a sort of path name).

	<br><br>
	In contrast to Microsoft Windows registry, the B4P resident attributes is an operating-system independent solution to store small amounts of data
	or settings conveniently.  One file may contain one or more settings.  Thd data format used is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

	<br><br>
	If a nested sub-attribute is created, then the values associated to the attributes are blank literals "", and not void.
	Example:  attribute write ( path[ ], file[ ], {local machine, local settings, date format}, "YYYY-MM-DD" ) will automatically assign "" to attribute name local machine, 
	and local settings if not yet existing.

"Comparison and Selection Functions":
  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Comparison and selection functions" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	Common programming languages use standard constructs like <b>if ... else</b> or condensed statements
	such as <i>[condition]</i> <b>?</b> <i>[expression if true]</i> <b>?</b> <i>[expression if false]</i>,
	Aiming to allow for more dense and efficient coding, B4P provides a set of effective comparison and
	selection functions.  The functions come in two fragrances:

	+++,
    "Description 02:select ... ()"::
	In these functions all parameters are fully calculated regardless of the condition and/or if the values are finally selected or discarded.
	This approach is most efficient if the values are constants or simple expression (e.g. a constant, referring to variable, a table entry,
	a simple calculation, etc.) or if manipulations must be made in any case, e.g. doing a function call or incrementing/decrementing variables.
	+++,
    "Examples 02:Program example - all expressions are calculated:"::
	a[] = select if( true, echo(yes), echo(no) ); // Note. Both 'yes' and 'no' are printed here
	echo("Result is ", a[] );
	+++,
    "Output 02:Result:": "automatic",
    "Description 03:pick ... ()"::
	In these functions, the expressions for the values to select are only calculated if the results are needed.  Otherwise, these expressions
	will be skipped.  This approach saves a lot of computation effort if more sophisticated expressions are contained.  In addition, if a variable
	in an expression not selected is not defined, this does not matter because that expression is skipped.
	+++,
    "Examples 03:Program example - 'echo(no)' is not executed:"::
	a[] = pick if( true, echo(yes), echo(no) ); // Note: Only 'yes' if printed
	echo("Result is ", a[] );
	+++,
    "Output 03:Output": "automatic"

"Directory and File System Functions":
  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "directory and file system functions" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	This subsection describes various functions to access and process files and directories.  Following key features 
	are included.

	* Accessing, searching and manipulating directories (create, change to, rename, remove directories)
	* Accessing, searching and manipulating files (directory listings, copy files, rename files, delete files)
	* Disk functions (e.g. disk size info)
	* Internet access (download files)

	+++,

    "Description 02:Path and File Names"::

	Under Windows, the path names are a chain of directory and subdirectory names separated with backslash '\' symbols.  Under LINUX and MACOS,
	the forward slash '/' is used.  Unless specified otherwise do add quotation marks to (sub-) directory and file names if they contain spaces.
	Avoid using symbols not supported or recommended by the operating systems, e.g. '<', , '&', '>' and ':'.

	<br><br>

	Beyond4P tolerates both slash symbols and does the operating system conversions automatically. Even a mix of both symbols are OK. Following examples are valid:
	* C:/Program Files\Beyond4P.exe
	* \usr\local/bin\Beyond4P

	<br><br>

	If the specified directory or file name contains no path name in front, then the current drive and working directory are assumed.

	<br><br>

	<u>Attention:</u> Directory and file names are case sensitive in LINUX and MACOS systems, but not in Windows.

	+++,
    "Description 03:Exception Handling"::

	Various procedures and functions contain <b>... silently</b> as ending part of their names.  This suffix
	lets Beyond4P to issue return values which are either "OK" or contain a short error message.  Without the
	suffix, an exception happens, program execution will stop and enters __interactive mode__.

	=== 250, 250, 500
	Return values for file functions	| Return values for directory functions | Description
	OK					| OK					| Successful execution
	Path not found				| Path not found			| Specified directory path not found or invalid
	File not Found				| Directory not found			| File / directory not found
	File access denied			| Directory access denied		| File / directory access denied. Insufficient privileges.
	File write-protected			| (n/a)					| File is write-protected.  Check protection settings.
	(n/a)					| Directory not empty			| Directory is not empty (contains files and/or sub-directories)
	File locked				| Directory locked			| File / directory is locked by other applications. Close the other application.
	File already existing			| Directory already existing		| File / The file already exists (e.g. attempt to overwrite with file copy function). For files, use the equivalent function name containing the suffix <b>overwrite</b>.
	File error				| Directory error			| Invalid file / directory name or file locked by other application.
	File invalid chars			| (n/a)					| File name contains invalid characters
	Can't move files across devices		| Can't move files across devices	| Can't move files across devices (with __file rename(__) function)
	File found directory expected		| Directory found file expected		| Specified directory name refers to an existing file, and vice versa

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The Microsoft Windows operating system provides a <i>registry</i> which is a hierarchical database to store sytem and application
	settings.  The contents in the registry affect the behavior of the operating system, windows graphical user interface and application
	program.  B4P provides a set of registry access functions, however access to them have been restricted due to a considerable risk
	that unexperienced usage could cause severe and irreversible harm to the system.  The B4P installer program is actually accessing the registry in order to
	assign the file type ".b4p" to the B4P program, and to assign the icon to that file type.

	<br><br>
	For the reason above, the B4P contains no description of the registry access functions.  Linux and MacOS do not maintain such a registry.
	If you intended to use the registry for storing individual values, then consider using the __resident attributes functions__ instead, and this one
	works on all supported operating systems.

	<br><br>
	Please contact us if you need to write a B4P program which needs to access the registry and you have a good reason for that.

	alphabetic			| Alphabetic order by UNICODE character set.
	alphabetic down			| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore case		| Alphabetic order, but ignores case (e.g. 'the Hague' comes before 'Uruguay')
	alphabetic down ignore case	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore blanks	| Same as alphabetic. Blanks (incl. new line, tabs, space) are ignored.  'St. Moritz' and 'St.Moritz' are equivalent.
	alphabetic down ignore blanks	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore both		| Same as alphabetic, ignoring both case and blanks
	alphabetic down ignore both	| Opposite direction of above
	numeric				| Sorts by numbers.  Non-numeric contents are interpreted like zero.  Smallest number comes first.
	numeric down			| Opposite direction of above
	date				| Sorts by dates.  Fields containing no qualified dates are interpreted like blank dates.  See rules below the table.
	===

	Rules on literals:
	* Blank literal '' comes first
	* One space symbol ' ' (UNICODE 32) comes next.
	* Sorting is done based on UNICODE character codes.
	* Sorting takes no cultural implications into consideration (e.g. Spanish: LL follows L).
	* Numbers are also treated as literals: 0100 comes before 10.

	Rules on numerals:
	* For contents beginning a number: The 1st number will be recognized.
	* For contents beginning with non-numeric symbols: Interpreted as zero.

	Rules on dates:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* If year is missing, current year is assumed.
	* If day is missing, the 1st day of month is assumed.
	* Month names in key languages like "Jan", "feb", "MÃ¤rz", "avril", "May", "juni", etc. are recognized as months and sorted accordingly.
	* Local settings are used as rules to resolve country dependent date formats like 01/02/2015 (day and month ordering: 2. Jan 2015 or 1. Feb 2015).  Local settings are in the system variables and can be changed.
	* Time values in the date are ignored.  E.g. "14.07.2016 10:00" and "14.07.2016 11:00" are treated as identical values

	Rules on dates and times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values without time come before date values with time (e.g. "00:00:00") if date are on the same day.
	* Time values are not ignored

	Rules on times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values are ignored.  "14.07.2016 10:00â and â15.07.2016 10:00â are treated as identical values
