  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Combining Multiple Tables" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The functions described next cover the art of combining two (or more) tables using the fine arts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra" target="_blank">relational algebra</a>
	where different algebraic rules can be applied to rows and columns.

	<br><br>

	In a simple example, two tables with members of two clubs (e.g. tennis and squash) need to be merged into one where the last and first names of the
	members shall act as matching identifiers.  In case no person has a membership in both clubs, no overlap applies, and the list will simply be
	appended where the data are aligned to the right columns, using header names as orientation.  The columns in both tables do not need to be aligned
	before the merger.  If one or more persons possess memberships in both clubs, then the information will be consolidated where the same 
	__ consolidation actions__ rules are available as used by __table consolidate__.  As an example, the account receivable (e.g.
	indoor court reservation fees to be balanced) can be added up whereas the preferences at the club bar can be consolidated with <b>append once</b>
	so the preference for tonic water at one club and beer at the other club will appended into "tonic water, beer".

	<br><br>

	If no identifier columns are defined in the functions described next, then every row will be considered unique.  Merging the table is treated appending two tables,
	with aligning the data into the right columns.	 

	<br><br>

	The following table summarizes the 25 functions in a 5 x 5 matrix with specifc rules to be applied on rows as wll as columns.
	The table contains illustrations on how the rows are combined (shades of red / orange / yellow) and how columns are combined (shades of
	gray and light blue).  The syntax of the function name does first describe the operation on the rows (e.g. __table merge__) followed by
	the operation on the columns (e.g. __table merge extend columns(__)).  If no extension like <b>... extend columns</b> is specified, then
	no additional columns are added in the target table and the data in the source table not fitting in the target table structure will not be taken over.

	* Dividing tables (binary division in relational algebra)

"Exploring and Extracting Tables":

    "Feature Names":		[ "Exploring and Extracting Tables" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	A new powerful B4P feature, consisting of three functions, is to identify, select and extract one or more sub-tables located inside a table.
	This becomes very useful when dealing with sophisticated tables created by external sources where you cannot advise them how to
	structure the data so you can use them easily.  Following three functions need to be called in sequence:

	__table explore(__): This function identifies all sub-tables inside a table where a few criteria settings are available to identify tables and keep them 
	separate from other contents, e.g. title texts.
	<br><br>
	This function returns a parameter set containing 0, 1 or more coordinates for every sub-table found.
	The sub-tables beginning on the same row must contain a spacing of 1 column.  Direct neighboring is possible if the next table begins at a different tow (Illustration: See sub-table 2 and 3).
	<br><br>
	__table filter(__): The collection of coordinates can be narrowed down by matching header contents with given patterns and specifying minimum 
	table widths and heights.  This function also returns the same kind of parameter set, but probably with fewer coordinates.
	<br><br>
	__table extract(__): This final function will extract a selected sub-table based on the coordinates and sub-table chosen.  
	Tables can be extracted either into new blank tables or added to existing tables, allowing to arrange them horizontally and/or vertically.

	Beyond4P tolerates both slash symbols and does the operating system conversions automatically. Even a mix of both symbols are OK. Following examples are valid:
	* C:/Program Files\Beyond4P.exe
	* \usr\local/bin\Beyond4P

"Sorting and Ranking Options":
  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Sorting options", "Ranking options" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The sorting options are used (amongst others) by following functions:
	* __table sort columns(__)
	* __table sort rows(__)
	* __table sort selected rows(__)
	* __table rank rows(__)
	* __table rank selected rows(__)

	+++,
    "Description 02:Overview of Available Options"::

	=== 200, 800, bold_column_1
	Sorting / Ranking Option 	| Description
	alphabetic			| Alphabetic order by UNICODE character set.
	alphabetic down			| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore case		| Alphabetic order, but ignores case (e.g. 'the Hague' comes before 'Uruguay')
	alphabetic down ignore case	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore blanks	| Same as alphabetic. Blanks (incl. new line, tabs, space) are ignored.  'St. Moritz' and 'St.Moritz' are equivalent.
	alphabetic down ignore blanks	| Opposite direction of above
	alphabetic ignore both		| Same as alphabetic, ignoring both case and blanks
	alphabetic down ignore both	| Opposite direction of above
	numeric				| Sorts by numbers.  Non-numeric contents are interpreted like zero.  Smallest number comes first.
	numeric down			| Opposite direction of above
	date				| Sorts by dates.  Fields containing no qualified dates are interpreted like blank dates.  See rules below the table.
	===

	Rules on literals:
	* Blank literal '' comes first
	* One space symbol ' ' (UNICODE 32) comes next.
	* Sorting is done based on UNICODE character codes.
	* Sorting takes no cultural implications into consideration (e.g. Spanish: LL follows L).
	* Numbers are also treated as literals: 0100 comes before 10.

	Rules on numerals:
	* For contents beginning a number: The 1st number will be recognized.
	* For contents beginning with non-numeric symbols: Interpreted as zero.

	Rules on dates:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* If year is missing, current year is assumed.
	* If day is missing, the 1st day of month is assumed.
	* Month names in key languages like "Jan", "feb", "MÃ¤rz", "avril", "May", "juni", etc. are recognized as months and sorted accordingly.
	* Local settings are used as rules to resolve country dependent date formats like 01/02/2015 (day and month ordering: 2. Jan 2015 or 1. Feb 2015).  Local settings are in the system variables and can be changed.
	* Time values in the date are ignored.  E.g. "14.07.2016 10:00" and "14.07.2016 11:00" are treated as identical values

	Rules on dates and times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values without time come before date values with time (e.g. "00:00:00") if date are on the same day.
	* Time values are not ignored

	Rules on times:
	* Blank dates come first.
	* Date values are ignored.  "14.07.2016 10:00â and â15.07.2016 10:00â are treated as identical values

	Following example shows a ranking based on the different options applied.

    "Feature Names":		[ "consolidation actions" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The sorting options are used (amongst others) by following functions:
	* __table consolidate(__)
	* __table merge(__) function family

	+++,
    "Description 02:Overview of Available Consolidation Actions"::

	The consolidation actions does only take place if a matching row further down in the table (or source table if 2 tables are combined) needs
	to be consolidated to the target fields.  No actions are applied if only one row exists with same identifer contents. 

	=== 200, 800, bold_column_1
	Consolidation Action		| Description
	none				| No consolidation: The destination fields will not be overwritten.<br>At the end of the consolidation run, the destination field contains the data from the first row belonging to the group.
	overwrite			| Source field overwrites destination field. <br>At the end of the consolidation run, the destination field contains the data from the last row belonging to the group.
	overwrite if blank		| Source field overwrites destination field if the destination field is still blank. See <sup>1</sup>
	overwrite except blank		| Source field overwrites destination field if the soruce field is not blank. See <sup>1</sup>
	blank				| Destination field will be blanked.  Useful to void contents no longer needed after consolidation.
	zero				| Destination field will be set to 0. Useful to void contents no longer needed after consolidation.
	delete				| This column will be deleted after the consolidation run.  Useful to get rid of contents no longer needed.
	append				| Append string contents from source fields to destination fields.  A separator string will be inserted if available.
	append once			| Like above, but contents are only appended if not yet found in the destination string.
	must match			| Checks source and destination fields.  If they differ, then <b>(Inconsistent)</b> will be written.
	blank if different		| Checks source and destination fields.  If they differ, then the destination fields will be blanked.
	min abc				| Choose the entry in the lower alphabetc sorting order (e.g. abc preferred over def). Blanks have highest priority. 
	min abc ignore blanks		| Choose the entry in the lower alphabetc sorting order (e.g. abc preferred over def). Blanks have lowest priority. See <sup>1</sup>
	max abc				| Choose the entry in the higher alphabetc sorting order (e.g. def preferred over abc). Blanks have lowest priority.
	min				| Choose the entry with the smaller value. Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	min ignore blanks		| Choose the entry with the smaller value. Blanks have lowest priority. Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	min ignore zero			| Choose the entry with the smaller value.  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero have lowest priority. See <sup>2</sup>
	max				| Choose the entry with the greater value. Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	max ignore blanks		| Choose the entry with the greater value. Blanks have lowest priority. Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	max ignore zero			| Choose the entry with the greater value.  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero have lowest priority. See <sup>2</sup>
	sum				| Calculates the sum: Adds source fields to destination fields.
	sum blank if zero		| Calculates the sum: Adds source fields to destination fields. If destination field is 0, it will be set to blank.
	product				| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.  Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	product ignore blanks		| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.  Blanks are ignore, but non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	product ignore zero		| Calculates the product: Multiplies source fields to destination fields.    Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero are ignored.  See <sup>2</sup>
	average				| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated). Blanks and non-numeric contents are treated as zero.
	average ignore blanks		| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated). Non-numeric contents are treated as zero. See <sup>1,2</sup>
	average ignore zero		| Calculates the average (sum divided by number of rows consolidated).  Blanks and non-numeric contents and zero are ignored. See <sup>2</sup>
	count				| Count all fields.  Is always 1 or bigger.
	count ignore blanks		| Count non-blank fields only. See <sup>1</sup>
	count ignore zero		| Count non-zero fields. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count positive			| Count if value is > 0. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count positive or zero		| Count if value is >= 0.  Blanks and non-numerals are treated as 0 and will be counted.
	count negative			| Count if value is < 0. 0, blanks and non-numerals are ignored.
	count negative or zero		| Count if value is <= 0.  Blanks and non-numerals are treated as 0 and will be counted.
	===

	<sup>1</sup> Fields are considered blank if they are absolutely blank, i.e. containing zero characters.  Fields containing white spaces (spaces, tabs, new lines, etc.) are not considered blank.<br>
	<sup>2</sup> If none of the fields qualify for calculation (e.g. min ignore blanks where all fields are blank), then the result will be zero.
