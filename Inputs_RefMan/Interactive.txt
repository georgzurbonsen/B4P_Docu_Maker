	Following appraoches are available to enter interactive mode:

	=== 300, 700, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Command line option -i		| Starting B4P with the command lien option <b>-i</b> will activate interactive mode immediately.
	Start interactive.b4p		| Run this B4P program available in the installation to enter interactive immediately
	Start B4P alone			| B4P will give you the choice to enter interactive mode or start 'main.b4p' if one is available
	Call 'interactive' function	| Add 'interactive;' in your B4P program to enter interactive mode.  Type 'return' to continue executing from there
	Exceptions (errors) happened	| In most exceptions (e.g. syntax errors, wrong parameters, etc.), interactive mode is entered so you can inspect your code, variables and loaded tables
	B4P waiting before starting "Main.b4p" | If B4P is started without B4P program file specified (i.e. <b>b4p</b> typed as sole command or started form desktop or start menu), then \
					  "Main.b4P" will start running after waiting for 2 seconds.  If a key is pressed, then this program will not start and interactive mode is entered.

	You are able to specfify multiple statements (example: <b>for (a[]=1, a[]<5, a[]++) echo(a[]); echo(Done.)</b>) in one line and they will
	be executed like a small B4P program.  Even angular braces <b>{ ... }</b> are allowed here to put multiple statements into one block.

	A semicolon is not required at the end of the last statement entered interactively.

"Basic Commands":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Basic Commands" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The following commands are recommended for interactive use and are described below:

	<br><br>

	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Command				| Description
	start ( Program Name.b4p )	| Start executing a B4P program.  Note: All variables created in that program will be global variables, even if defined outside user-defined procedures and functions.
	return				| Return to executing the program.  Very useful if interactive mode is activated using an <b>interactive;</b> statement.
	exit				| Leaves B4P run-time machine
	Pressing CTRL+C			| Leaves B4P run-time machine, too
	prompt ("...")			| You can change the prompt.  See __prompt(__) for more details.  Qutoation marks are required here.
	prompt ("working directory()" ) | Choose to show the working directory in the prompt.  It will be memorized until changed again or reset.
	prompt ("system info[user name]") | Choose to show your user name in the prompt.  You can combine mulitple info, e.g. showing both user name and current path name.
	prompt ("")			| Reset prompt to factory settings
	===
	+++,

    "Description 02:Examples"::
	Change the prompt interactively
	+++,
    "Examples 02:"::
>> prompt ("working directory()+' >>'" )
C:\Users\User Name\Documents\Programs\B4P >> prompt ("system info[user name]+':'")
User Name: prompt('')
>> exit
	+++

},



"Operating System Commands":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Operating System Commands" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "OS Commands" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The B4P interactive mode provides direct access to operating system commands.  Simply begin the OS commands wiht a dollar sign <b>$</b> in front.
	Operating-specific features like redirecting input/output of commands executed as well as piping are obviously supported.
	<br><br>

	=== 400, 300, 300, bold_column_2  bold_column_3
	Example				| Windows				| Linux / MacOS
	Clear the screen		| $ cls					| $ clear
	Change drive			| $ D:					| (not applicable)
	Show current directory		| $ cd					| $ pwd
	Change directory		| $ cd ..\directory			| $ cd ../directory
	Open a PDF document		| $ start abc.pdf			| $ open abc.pdf
	===

	Please note that the operating system commands are executed in separate child processes.  For this reason, B4P inspects the entered commands
	and will also change the current drive and/or directory if commands to change drives and/or directores (<b>cd, chdir</b>) are recognized.

	<br><br>
	Alternative, you can use the __system(__) function to execute operating system commands.  This fuction can also be used in B4P programs.

	+++,

    "Description 02:Examples"::
	The following example shows how to enter a sub-directory by name, step out again, and back in using a wildcard.
	B4P confirms that it has identified the path names and changes the working directory inside B4P, too.
	+++,
    "Examples 02:"::
>> $ cd examples
B4P: Verify and resolve path 'examples' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\examples\'

>> $ cd ..
B4P: Verify and resolve path '..' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\'

>> $ cd ex*
B4P: Verify and resolve path 'ex*' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\Examples\'

>> exit
