    "Description 01:Verbose Level Settings"::

	The __system variable__ <b>runtime settings[verbose]</b> rules the amount of additional console output messages to be generated which
	could be helpful for developing the code.  The default verbose setting is <b>low</b>.  This setting can be changed anytime.
	In addition, if the B4P program is called from command line, the command line switches <b>-q</b> and <b>-w</b> will set this setting to <b>quiet</b>.

	Following verbose settings are supported:

	<b>quiet</b><br>
	* No additional output is generated other than explicitly instructed in the B4P programs, e.g. using __echo(__) or __print(__).
	* However, error messages and important warning messages will definitely appear.

	<b>low</b>: in addition to 'quiet' (default setting):

	* Outputs progress info (percentage figures shown) if selected functions are processing big amount of data (e.g. large tables, large variable trees)
	* Short feedback messages on tables and variables loaded and saved (name of file, number of rows, etc.)
	* Info about standard B4P library files loaded (e.g. Support Library)
	* Some warnings, e.g. obsolete character sets found in input files

	<b>medium</b>: in addition to 'low':

	* Outputs the function names for the more sophisticated functions (e.g. __table consolidate(__) is included, but __abs(__) is not in order to avoid excessive messages) with first few paramters
	* Informs about the intermediate processing steps inside selected functions, e.g. __table load excel file(__)

	<b>high</b>: in addition to 'medium':

	* In addition to the function names printed out, all parameters provided will also be shown.
	* Further information on intermediate processing steps inside selected functions, e.g. __table merge (__)
