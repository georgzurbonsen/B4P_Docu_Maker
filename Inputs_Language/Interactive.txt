	Following appraoches are available to enter interactive mode:

	=== 300, 700, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Command line option -i		| Starting B4P with the command lien option <b>-i</b> will activate interactive mode immediately.
	Start interactive.b4p		| Run this B4P program available in the installation to enter interactive immediately
	Start B4P alone			| B4P will give you the choice to enter interactive mode or start 'main.b4p' if one is available
	Call 'interactive' function	| Add 'interactive;' in your B4P program to enter interactive mode.  Type 'return' to continue executing from there
	Exceptions (errors) happened	| In most exceptions (e.g. syntax errors, wrong parameters, etc.), interactive mode is entered so you can inspect your code, variables and loaded tables
	B4P waiting before starting "Main.b4p" | If B4P is started without B4P program file specified (i.e. <b>b4p</b> typed as sole command or started form desktop or start menu), then \
					  "Main.b4P" will start running after waiting for 2 seconds.  If a key is pressed, then this program will not start and interactive mode is entered.

"Basic Commands":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Basic Commands" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The following commands are recommended for interactive use and are described below:

	<br><br>

	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Command				| Description
	start ( Program Name.b4p )	| Start executing a B4P program.  Note: All variables created in that program will be global variables, even if defined outside user-defined procedures and functions.
	return				| Return to executing the program.  Very useful if interactive mode is activated using an <b>interactive;</b> statement.
	exit				| Leaves B4P execution engine
	Pressing CTRL+C			| Leaves B4P execution engine, too
	prompt ("...")			| You can change the prompt.  See __prompt(__) for more details.  Qutoation marks are required here.
	prompt ("working directory()" ) | Choose to show the working directory in the prompt.  It will be memorized until changed again or reset.
	prompt ("system info[user name]") | Choose to show your user name in the prompt.  You can combine mulitple info, e.g. showing both user name and current path name.
	prompt ("")			| Reset prompt to factory settings
	===
	+++,

    "Description 02:Examples"::
	Change the prompt interactively
	+++,
    "Examples 02:"::
>> prompt ("working directory()+' >>'" )
C:\Users\User Name\Documents\Programs\B4P >> prompt ("system info[user name]+':'")
User Name: prompt('')
>> exit
	+++

},



"Operating System Commands":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Operating System Commands" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "OS Commands" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The B4P interactive mode provides direct access to operating system commands.  Simply begin the OS commands wiht a dollar sign <b>$</b> in front.
	Operating-specific features like redirecting input/output of commands executed as well as piping are obviously supported.
	<br><br>

	=== 400, 300, 300, bold_column_2  bold_column_3
	Example				| Windows				| Linux / MacOS
	Clear the screen		| $ cls					| $ clear
	Change drive			| $ D:					| (not applicable)
	Show current directory		| $ cd					| $ pwd
	Change directory		| $ cd ..\directory			| $ cd ../directory
	Open a PDF document		| $ start abc.pdf			| $ open abc.pdf
	===

	Please note that the operating system commands are executed in separate child processes.  For this reason, B4P inspects the entered commands
	and will also change the current drive and/or directory if commands to change drives and/or directores (<b>cd, chdir</b>) are recognized.

	<br><br>
	Alternative, you can use the __system(__) function to execute operating system commands.  This fuction can also be used in B4P programs.

	+++,

    "Description 02:Examples"::
	The following example shows how to enter a sub-directory by name, step out again, and back in using a wildcard.
	B4P confirms that it has identified the path names and changes the working directory inside B4P, too.
	+++,
    "Examples 02:"::
>> $ cd examples
B4P: Verify and resolve path 'examples' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\examples\'

>> $ cd ..
B4P: Verify and resolve path '..' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\'

>> $ cd ex*
B4P: Verify and resolve path 'ex*' ...
     OK. Current directory changed to 'C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programme\Beyond4P\B4P_Docu_Maker\Examples\'

>> exit

"Interactive Input and Editing":
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Interactive input", "Interactive editing" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	In __interactive mode__ and other occasions where line input is requested, e.g. with the __input(__) and __table menu(__) functions,
	following editing features are available, as long B4P has not been started with the __command line switches__ <b>-c</b>
	for disabling console features (but suitable for batch processing) and <b>-I</b> for installation scripts.

	<br><br>
	<u>Note:</u> If either of the two beforementioned switches are used, then B4P uses standard input and output, allowing to redirect
	text I/O using pipes and other features.  All (distracting) console features will be kept inactive.

	<br><br>
	While entering text, following features are available:

	=== 200, 800, bold_column_1
	Key			| Function
	Arrow left		| Moves cursor 1 character to the left <sup>1</sup>
	CTRL-Arrow left		| Moves cursor 1 word to the left <sup>1</sup>
	Arrow right		| Moves cursor 1 character to the right <sup>1</sup>
	CTRL-Arrow right	| Moves cursor 1 word to the right <sup>1</sup>
	Home			| Moves cursor to 1st position <sup>1</sup>
	End			| Moves cursor to the end of the entered contents <sup>1</sup>
	Arrow up		| Accesses the history of previously entered commands and/or strings, beginning with the most recent one.
	Arrow down		| Accesses the next more recently entered command and/or strings
	CTRL-K			| Delete remaining text starting with the cursor
	CTRL-C			| Copies marked text to clipboard <sup>2</sup>
	CTRL-X			| Cuts marked text to clipboard
	CTRL-V			| Pastes contents from the clipboard
	Backspace key		| Deletes the character on the left to the cursor and moves the cursor one character back
	Delete key		| Deletes the character underneath the cursor
	Insert key		| Toggles between insert and overwriting mode.  In overwriting mode, the next character to be overwritten is \
				  marked and can also be cut or copied into the clipboard.
	===
	<sup>1</sup> Text can be marked for cutting and copying when holding the shift key down and using the cursor navigation keys.  Unfortunately, the mouse cannot be used. <br>
	<sup>2</sup> Typing two CTRL-C consecutively will stop program execution

    "Description 02:History of Recorded Commands and Strings"::

	As mentioned in the table above, the vertical arrow keys support an input history.
	<br><br>

	The history of entered commands and strings are recorded in the following system variable: <b>libraries[console library,history[</b><i>n</i><b>]</b>
	where the number <i>n</i> is the array index.  The first entered string gets index 0, with the additionally captured commands and/or strings following next
	and ending with the most recently entered command or string. If a string identical with one in the history is entered, then the position of the stored
	string will be moved to the most recent position in the array.

    "Description 03:Clipboard"::

	The clipboard as provided by the operating system will be used and allows cross application use.  Copying texts will be made available as both plain ANSI and UNICODE text.
	In the other direction, both plain ANSI and UNICODE text can be pasted.  Attempting to paste HTML contents, image and other objects will not work.

	<br><br>

	<b>Using the mouse:</b> B4P does not support the mouse directly.  However, you can mark the text with the mouse and use the copy / paste features in the
	top menu bar or menu box after clicking the right mouse key to initiate copying and pasting text.

	<br><br>

	<u>Note: </u>Under LINUX, the <b>xclip</b> utility will be used.  Make sure this utility is installed, e.g. with <b>sudo apt-get install xclip</b>.<br>
	Under MacOS, the standard <b>pbcopy</b> and <b>pbpaste</b> utilities are used internally.
