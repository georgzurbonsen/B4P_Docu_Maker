"MacOS - Batch Installation" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "MacOS - Batch Installation" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The installation script can also be executed as a batch so all user interaction (keyboard or mouse input) during the
	the installation process is suppressed.  The automated installation process is made possible using __long options__ when
	starting the installation using a command typed interactively or executed from a batch file.

	<br><br>
	Example:  <b>sudo ./setup --choice=machine --locale=en-US</b><br>
	Required super user (administrator) privileges are enabled with the 'sudo' prefix.

	<br><br>
	The example above initiates a software installation for the local machine using the locale settings "en-US" (English /
	United States).  Using the long option '--choice' in the command will automatically treat the installation process
	as a batch process.  The other options can be used alone in order to skip individual queries, for exmaple getting asked
	for locale settings

	<br><br>

	
	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Option				| Explanation
	--help				| Help text about the options will be shown on the console.  No installation will be initiated, even if other options are provided.
	--choice=machine<br>\
	--choice=deinstall<br>\
	--choice=info<br>\
	--choice=exit<br>		| Do installation on local machine for all users<br>\
					  De-install B4P<br>\
					  Provide information for generating a license<br>\
					  Exit installation program without any actions<br>\
					  The option '--choice' will ensure that the whole installation process is suitable for batch processing.
	--keep-user-settings		| The user settings from the previous installation (e.g. prompt) will be kept.
	--keep-my-init			| Keep own 'My B4P Init.b4p' file which can carry out user-specific initialization sequences
	--keep-my-themes		| Keep own 'B4P Style Themes.xlsx' file and do not use the newest one provided in the installation.
	--create-personal-folder	| Create a personal folder for own programs.
	--license=keep<br>\
	--license=new<br>\
	--license=no<br>\
	--license="<i>Lic. File Name.json</i>"	| Keep the existing license from the previous installation, if applicable <br>\
					  Use the new license file as provided in the installation directory (B4P License File.json)<br>\
					  Do not apply the license.  B4P shall run in demo mode only<br>\
					  Use specified path and file name (.json) containing the license information.
	--locale=keep<br>\
	--locale=xx_YY			| Keep the existing locale settings from the previous installation<br>\
					  Specify the combination of ISO 2-character language and country code.  The locale will be accepted if supported \
					  in the file "List of Locales.csv".  For a first-time batch installation on a new target, the local must be specified. <br>\
					  <u>Note:</u> Use the locale settings as used by Excel since you want to align on number formats, date formats and list separators.
	===	

	When the installer is finalizing, then it will pause for 3 seconds, giving users the chance to see the last info shown, in case the console
	window closes automatically after installation.
