    "Description 01:Overview"::
	The roots of B4P date back to 2007 when the first C/C++ object class library has been developed to process
	tables, but the solutions were still coded in C/C++.  The first version of the B4P language appeared in 2013,
	following a series of improvments and extensions aiming to solve any form of business and analytical problems
	involving big data.

	<br><br>
	The updates made in the most recent releases are summarized in the following subsections.
