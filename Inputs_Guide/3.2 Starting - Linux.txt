    "Description 01:Introduction"::

    The <i>ubuntu</i> distribution is the preferred choice for B4P.  All verifications have been
    carried out on ubuntu.

    This section provides an introduction on how to __edit B4P Programs on Linux__ as well
    as different variants to start the B4P Analytics Engine and B4P Programs:

    * __Starting a B4P Program with Linux__
    * __Starting the B4P Engine with Linux__

	+++,
    "Description 02:The personal B4P folder"::

    Under Linux, the personal B4P folder is subdirectory <b>b4p</b> in your home directory.
    This folder, which is also the initial __starting directory__ after completing the installation, contains some a few programs:
    * <b>main.b4p</b> - Started if B4P is started without B4P program and finds this directory as starting directory.
    * <b>hello world.b4p</b> - Displays 'Hello World'
    * <b>interactive.b4p</b> - Starts B4P and goes directly into __interactive mode__
    * <b>start B4P here.b4p</b> - Simple utility to change starting directory.  Copy this file into a different directory and run it from there. B4P will then look for "main.b4p" in that location.
    * <b>B4P Reference Manual.b4p</b> - Opens online documentation

    "Examples 02:"::
username@domain:~$ cd b4p

'B4P Reference Manual.b4p'  'hello world.b4p'   interactive.b4p   main.b4p  'start B4P here.b4p'

    "Feature Names":		[ "Edit B4P Programs on Linux" ],

    "Description 01:Edit B4P on Linux"::

    B4P programs are standard text files in ANSI or UNICODE formaT. B4P will recognize the character format
    automatically.

    LINUX provides a wide selection of editors, such as <i>vi</i>, <i>emacs</i>, <i>gedit</i> and <i>Visual Studio Code</i>.  They are all fine as long
    the do not embed any text formattings such as different fonts, colors, etc.

    "Feature Names":		[ "Starting a B4P Program with Linux" ],

    "Description 01:Starting a B4P Program on Linux - Hello World"::

    Two possibilites exist to start B4P programs:

    * __Start B4P Programs as Executables on Linux__, e.g. by typing <b>./"hello world.b4p"</b> . <br>\
      <u>Good to know:</u> Wildcards are allowed as long the file does not become ambiguous, e.g. <b>./hello*</b> .
    * __Linux Start B4P to run B4P programs__, e.g. <b>b4p "hello world.b4p"</b> .

    Quotation marks are needed on files if they contain spaces.

{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Start B4P Programs as Executables on Linux" ],

    "Description 01:Starting Hello World - Do the following steps"::

    Make sure that the B4P programs you are creating fulfill follwing two requirements:

    * The mode settings must allow file execution.  Use <b>chmod 755 <i>filename.b4p</i></b> to do so
    * Add the chebang statement at the very beginning of the file: <b>#!/usr/local/bin/b4p</b>.  Linux recognizes the \
      chebang and ensures that B4P and not a different runtime engine or interpreter, for example the Linux shells, is trying to run this program.

    <u>Good to know:</u> The "hello world.b4p" file does already fulfilll these two prerequistes.

    <br><br>

    <u>Note:</u>If B4P is started for the first time, the it will search and memorize the location of the 7-Zip compression utility.
    This will happen only once after the installation and needs a few seconds of time.

    "Examples 01:Go into the available B4P directory"::
username@domain:~$ cd b4p
username@domain:~/b4p$ ls
	+++,

    "Output 01:"::
'B4P Reference Manual.b4p'   interactive.b4p  'start B4P here.b4p'
'hello world.b4p'            main.b4p
	+++,

    "Examples 02:Take a look at 'hello world.b4p'"::
username@domain:~/b4p$ cat 'hello world.b4p'
	+++,

    "Output 02:"::
#!/usr/local/bin/b4p

// The statement in the 1st row applies to UNIX/Linux/MacOS only and is called a "Shebang".
// It specifies the language interpreter to use when started as an executable file.
// You can delete this line it if you plan to use B4P under Windows only.

// Shebangs are ignored in Microsoft Windows environments.

echo(Hello World);

    "Examples 03:Run the program"::
username@domain:~/b4p$ ./'hello world.b4p'

    "Feature Names":		[ "Starting the B4P Engine with Linux" ],

    "Description 01:Starting a B4P Program on Linux"::

	B4P can also be started without specifying a dedicated file name.  In this case, it will first look for "main.b4p" in the current
	directory (if started from command line).  If the file is not found, then it will look for "main.b4p" in __starting directory__.
	If not successful, then interactive mode is started.

	<br><br>

	In the next example, B4P starts and finds 'main.b4p' in the initial starting directory which is the subdirectory 'b4p' in your home directory.
