    "Description 02:The personal B4P folder"::

    Under Linux, the personal B4P folder created after installation is subdirectory <b>Documents\Programs\B4P</b> in your home directory.
    This folder, which is also the initial __starting directory__ after completing the installation, contains some a few programs:
    * <b>main.b4p</b> - Started if B4P is started without B4P program and finds this directory as starting directory.
    * <b>hello world.b4p</b> - Displays 'Hello World'
    * <b>interactive.b4p</b> - Starts B4P and goes directly into __interactive mode__
    * <b>start B4P here.b4p</b> - Simple utility to change starting directory.  Copy this file into a different directory and run it from there. B4P will then look for "main.b4p" in that location.
