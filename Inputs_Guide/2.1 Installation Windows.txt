},


"Windows - Prerequisites" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Windows Prerequisites" ],

    "Description 01:System Requirements"::
	* Personal computer running Windows 7.0 or higher
	* 64 bit CPU (we are not supporting legacy platforms)
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. admin rights on your local machine)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

    "Description 02:Software Requirements"::
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Web browser installed: Microsoft Explorer, Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome
	* Install <b>7-ZIP</b>, a free of charge compression and decompression tool.  This tool is needed because standard Windows installations provide no command level ZIP tool.  \
	  Without this tool, some functions, including file compression/decompression functions and loading Excel files, will not work.

	Click on the following link: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank"><b>https://www.7-zip.org/download.html</b></a> to download aind install 7-ZIP.

	+++,
    "Description 03:Select Country and Language Settings"::
	The B4P installaion program asks for both language and country.  This combination is a <i>locale</i> information which rules
	things like number and date format, currency symbols, month and weekday names in the specified language, etc.

	<br><br>

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and numbers may either make use of decimal points or commas.

	+++,
    "Examples 03:"::

"Windows - Batch Installation" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Windows - Batch Installation" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The installation script can also be executed as a batch so all user interaction (keyboard or mouse input) during the
	the installation process is suppressed.  The automated installation process is made possible using __long options__ when
	starting the installation using a command typed interactively or executed from a batch file.

	<br><br>
	Example:  <b>setup --choice=machine --locale=en-US</b>

	<br><br>
	The example above initiates a software installation for the local machine using the locale settings "en-US" (English /
	United States).  Using the long option '--choice' in the command will automatically treat the installation process
	as a batch process.  The other options can be used alone in order to skip individual queries, for exmaple getting asked
	for locale settings

	<br><br>

	
	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Option				| Explanation
	--help				| Help text about the options will be shown on the console.  No installation will be initiated, even if other options are provided.
	--choice=machine<br>\
	--choice=user<br>\
	--choice=deinstall<br>\
	--choice=info<br>\
	--choice=exit<br>		| Do installation on local machine for all users<br>\
					  Do installation for current user account on<br>\
					  De-install B4P<br>\
					  Exit installation program without any actions<br>\
					  The option '--choice' will ensure that the whole installation process is suitable for batch processing.
	--keep-user-settings		| The user settings from the previous installation (e.g. prompt) will be kept.
	--keep-my-init			| Keep own 'My B4P Init.b4p' file which can carry out user-specific initialization sequences
	--keep-my-themes		| Keep own 'B4P Style Themes.xlsx' file and do not use the newest one provided in the installation.
	--create-shortcuts		| Create two shortcuts on the desktop: 1. The B4P, and 2. access to online documentation.
	--create-personal-folder	| Create a personal folder for own programs.
	--locale=keep<br>\
	--locale=xx_YY			| Keep the existing locale settings from the previous installation<br>\
					  Specify the combination of ISO 2-character language and country code.  The locale will be accepted if supported \
					  in the file "List of Locales.csv".  For a first-time batch installation on a new target, the local must be specified. <br>\
					  <u>Note:</u> Use the locale settings as used by Excel since you want to align on number formats, date formats and list separators.
	===	

	When the installer is finalizing, then it will pause for 3 seconds, giving users the chance to see the last info shown, in case the console
	window closes automatically after installation.
