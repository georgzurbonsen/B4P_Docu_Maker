"Windows - Prerequisites" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Windows Prerequisites" ],

    "Description 01:System Requirements"::
	* Personal computer running Windows 7.0 or higher
	* 64 bit CPU (we are not supporting legacy platforms)
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. admin rights on your local machine)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

    "Description 02:Software Requirements"::
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Web browser installed: Microsoft Explorer, Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome
	* Install <b>7-ZIP</b>, a free of charge compression and decompression tool.  This tool is needed because standard Windows installations provide no command level ZIP tool.  \
	  Without this tool, some functions, including file compression/decompression functions and loading Excel files, will not work.

	Click on the following link: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank"><b>https://www.7-zip.org/download.html</b></a> to download aind install 7-ZIP.

	+++,
    "Description 03:Select Country and Language Settings"::
	The B4P installaion program asks for both language and country.  This combination is a <i>locale</i> information which rules
	things like number and date format, currency symbols, month and weekday names in the specified language, etc.

	<br><br>

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and numbers may either make use of decimal points or commas.

    "Description 05:Activating B4P with License File or in Demo Mode"::
	If you do not have a license file and you plan to use B4P for demonstration, evaluation and/or educational purposes,
	then press [Enter] to continue.  Otherwise, specify the full path an file name of the license file you have
	received in order to deactivate all restrictions.

	<br><br>
	<u>Hint</u>: Instead of typing the full path and file name: if you see the license file in an explorer file, copy the path
	from the address bar, paste it into the line, and then copy the file name (not the whole file) and paste it here, with a directory separator inbetween.
	B4P will verify if the file is available and the license code is valid.  If not, the query will be repeated.

	+++,

    "Examples 05:"::

15 >> Program Licensing ...


License activation ...

    Specify the license file (typically called 'B4P Licsense File.json'), or
    press [Enter] to skip this and run B4P in demo mode with some restrictions.
    Enter path + file name or press [Enter] to skip
    -->
    Nothing entered.  B4P will be activated in demo mode.

>>  Congratulations! Installation has been completed.

	+++,
    "Description 06:Option - Create a personal folder"::
	This is a nice feature especially for beginners. Highly recommended.
	A directory called <b>C:\Users\<i>Your user name</i>\Documents\Programs\B4P</b> will be created
	and contains the following files: 
	* hello world.b4p
	* interacctive b4p
	* main.b4p
	* start B4P here.b4p

	In case the folder is already existing, then only the missing files will be overwritten.  This is the case if you redo the installation.

	+++,
    "Examples 06:"::
    Do you want to create a personal B4P program folder ?  Y
    Creating directory: C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programs\B4P
    If directory or files already exist, then existing files will not be overwritten.

    Done creating this directory.
    When you start B4P from start menu or desktop without file specified, the 'Main.b4p'
    in this directory will be started.


    Highly advisable to restart your machine so all configuration settings for this installation are in effect.


Done - Press ENTER key

    +++,
    "Description 07:Concluding the Installation"::
	Press [Enter] to close the console window.  Now you are ready to start working with B4P.

"Windows - Batch Installation" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Windows - Batch Installation" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The installation script can also be executed as a batch so all user interaction (keyboard or mouse input) during the
	the installation process is suppressed.  The automated installation process is made possible using __long options__ when
	starting the installation using a command typed interactively or executed from a batch file.

	<br><br>
	Example:  <b>setup --choice=machine --locale=en-US</b>

	<br><br>
	The example above initiates a software installation for the local machine using the locale settings "en-US" (English /
	United States).  Using the long option '--choice' in the command will automatically treat the installation process
	as a batch process.  The other options can be used alone in order to skip individual queries, for exmaple getting asked
	for locale settings

	<br><br>

	
	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Option				| Explanation
	--help				| Help text about the options will be shown on the console.  No installation will be initiated, even if other options are provided.
	--choice=machine<br>\
	--choice=user<br>\
	--choice=deinstall<br>\
	--choice=info<br>\
	--choice=exit<br>		| Do installation on local machine for all users<br>\
					  Do installation for current user account on<br>\
					  De-install B4P<br>\
					  Provide information for generating a license<br>\
					  Exit installation program without any actions<br>\
					  The option '--choice' will ensure that the whole installation process is suitable for batch processing.
	--keep-user-settings		| The user settings from the previous installation (e.g. prompt) will be kept.
	--keep-my-init			| Keep own 'My B4P Init.b4p' file which can carry out user-specific initialization sequences
	--keep-my-themes		| Keep own 'B4P Style Themes.xlsx' file and do not use the newest one provided in the installation.
	--create-shortcuts		| Create two shortcuts on the desktop: 1. The B4P, and 2. access to online documentation.
	--create-personal-folder	| Create a personal folder for own programs.
	--license=keep<br>\
	--license=new<br>\
	--license=no<br>\
	--license="<i>Lic. File Name.json</i>"	| Keep the existing license from the previous installation, if applicable <br>\
					  Use the new license file as provided in the installation directory (B4P License File.json)<br>\
					  Do not apply the license.  B4P shall run in demo mode only<br>\
					  Use specified path and file name (.json) containing the license information.
	--locale=keep<br>\
	--locale=xx_YY			| Keep the existing locale settings from the previous installation<br>\
					  Specify the combination of ISO 2-character language and country code.  The locale will be accepted if supported \
					  in the file "List of Locales.csv".  For a first-time batch installation on a new target, the local must be specified. <br>\
					  <u>Note:</u> Use the locale settings as used by Excel since you want to align on number formats, date formats and list separators.
	===	

	When the installer is finalizing, then it will pause for 3 seconds, giving users the chance to see the last info shown, in case the console
	window closes automatically after installation.
