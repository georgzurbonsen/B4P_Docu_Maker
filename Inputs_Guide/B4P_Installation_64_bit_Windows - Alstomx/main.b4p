// The statement in the 1st row applies to UNIX/Linux/MacOS only and is called a "Shebang".
// It specifies the language interpreter to use when started as an executable file.
// You can delete this line it if you plan to use B4P under Windows only.

// Linux/MacOS: The command line option -x in the Shebang statement instructs B4P
// to return directly to the shell or calling program without asking to
// push [Enter].  This is suitable for embedding B4P code in batch scripts.

// Shebangs are ignored in Microsoft Windows environments.
