    "Feature Names":		[ "Installation on Windows" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The following pages provide step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing
	the B4P applications for Windows.

	<br><br>
	<b>System requirements:</b>
	* Personal computer running Windows 7.0 or higher
	* 64 bit CPU (we are not supporting legacy platforms)
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. admin rights on your local machine)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

	<b>Special software requirements:</b>
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Web browser installed: Microsoft Explorer, Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome
	* Install <b>7-ZIP</b>, a free of charge compression and decompression tool.  This tool is needed because standard Windows installations provide no command level ZIP tool.  \
	  Without this tool, some functions, including file compression/decompression functions and loading Excel files, will not work.

	Click on the following link: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank"><b>https://www.7-zip.org/download.html</b></a> to download aind install 7-ZIP.

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	B4P for Windows can be downloaded by clicking on the following link:

	<br><br>

	( Placeholder for a link to download the file )

	<br><br>

	With the download carried out, you automatically agree to accept the __Terms and Conditions__ for use of the B4P run-time machine and all
	asscociated files such as libraries.  The terms and conditions are binding at any time you are using B4P.

	<br><br>

    "Description 02:Extracting the Files"::

	The downloaded file is a compressed <b>.zip</b> file.
	* Move the .zip file into a directory where you want to extract it
	* Then use the right mouse key to click on the file.  A pop-up menu occurs and use the the decompression option provided by Windows or 7-ZIP.

	<br><br>
	You should see the following extracted files and directories:

	=== 300, 700, noheader, bold_column_1
	B4P.exe			| B4P run-time machine including the language interpreter. A link to this file will be included in the start menu and added to the desktop if requested.
	Setup.exe		| B4P installation program
	Install.txt		| Installation script, open source, written in B4P.  This program is protected from modifications.
	vcruntime140_1.dll	| Dynamic link library used by B4P.exe
	b4picon.ico		| Windows icon for B4P files (.b4p filetype)
	List of Locales.csv	| Contains locale-specific details (e.g. number and date formats, weekday and months in different language, etc.)
	lib\			| Directory containing B4P library files
	weblib\			| Directory containing Web-specific library features written in JavaScript
	===
	<br>
	The contents in 'weblib' contain some CSS files and Javascript codes files which are provided by SpryMedia Ltd, Scottland, and are in use under the MIT license.

	interactive.b4p			| A 1-statement B4P program going to interactive mode directly
	B4P Reference Manual.b4p	| A 2-statement B4P program opening the online reference manual on a browser of choice.  A link to this file will be included in the start menu and added to the desktop if requested.
	hello world.b4p			| Self-explanatory
	start B4P here.b4p		| A 1-statement B4P program which sets current directoy as starting directory. If B4P is started without a B4P program file, then B4P \
					  will look in this directory for 'main.b4p'.  If not found, then it will go into interactive mode.
	My B4P Init.b4p			| A user-customizable B4P initialization file and template which will be copied into the user application directory and you.

Please select:
	+++,
    "Description 02:"::
	Choice 'M' makes the installation visible for all users and puts the executable file into a subdirectory of <b>C:\Program Files\B4P</b>.  
	However, Choice 'U' puts the file into a directory owned by you only and will not be visible by other users sharing the same machine.
	If no specific issues apply, choice 'M' is strongly recommended.

	<br><br>
	The output shown below has been shortened in this documentation.  The installer will list all working steps and files processed.

	+++,
    "Description 03:Select Country and Language Settings"::
	The B4P installaion program asks for both language and country.  This combination is a <i>locale</i> information which rules
	things like number and date format, currency symbols, month and weekday names in the specified language, etc.

	<br><br>

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and numbers may either make use of decimal points or commas.

	+++,
    "Examples 03:"::
11 >> Restore user and locale settings (if available) ...

    User settings file: skipped.

    No locale settings have been defined yet.

	+++,
    "Description 04:Add Shortcut on the Windows Desktop"::
	If you reply positively, then two icons will be added to your desktop: The B4P run-time machine, and the link to the B4P online documentation.

...
14.2 >> Windows - Include B4P in path environment variable.
...
	+++,
    "Description 05:Activating B4P with License File or in Demo Mode"::
	If you do not have a license file and you plan to use B4P for demonstration, evaluation and/or educational purposes,
	then press [Enter] to continue.  Otherwise, specify the full path an file name of the license file you have
	received in order to deactivate all restrictions.

	<br><br>
	<u>Hint</u>: Instead of typing the full path and file name: if you see the license file in an explorer file, copy the path
	from the address bar, paste it into the line, and then copy the file name (not the whole file) and paste it here, with a directory separator inbetween.
	B4P will verify if the file is available and the license code is valid.  If not, the query will be repeated.

	+++,

    "Examples 05:"::

15 >> Program Licensing ...


License activation ...

    Specify the license file (typically called 'B4P Licsense File.json'), or
    press [Enter] to skip this and run B4P in demo mode with some restrictions.
    Enter path + file name or press [Enter] to skip
    -->
    Nothing entered.  B4P will be activated in demo mode.

>>  Congratulations! Installation has been completed.

	+++,
    "Description 06:Option - Create a personal folder"::
	This is a nice feature especially for beginners. Highly recommended.
	A directory called <b>C:\Users\<i>Your user name</i>\Documents\Programs\B4P</b> will be created
	and contains the following files: 
	* hello world.b4p
	* interacctive b4p
	* main.b4p
	* start B4P here.b4p

	In case the folder is already existing, then only the missing files will be overwritten.  This is the case if you redo the installation.

	+++,
    "Examples 06:"::
    Do you want to create a personal B4P program folder ?  Y
    Creating directory: C:\Users\Zur Bonsen Georg\Documents\Programs\B4P
    If directory or files already exist, then existing files will not be overwritten.

    Done creating this directory.
    When you start B4P from start menu or desktop without file specified, the 'Main.b4p'
    in this directory will be started.


    Highly advisable to restart your machine so all configuration settings for this installation are in effect.


Done - Press ENTER key

    +++,
    "Description 07:Concluding the Installation"::
	Press [Enter] to close the console window.  Now you are ready to start working with B4P.

"Windows - Getting Started" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Windows Getting Started" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	As a general advice, restart your machine because various graphic icons will not show up immediately and
	the paths needed to start B4P from command line will be effective after the restart only.

	<br><br>

	As a first step, go to <b>C:\Users\<i>Your user name</i>\Documents\Programs\B4P</b>.
	Using the Microsoft file explorer, right-click on the file <b>Hello World.b4p</b> and choose <b>Edit</b> in the
	pop-up menu. Depending on your country and language settings in Windows, it may be in a different language, 
	but typically it's the 2nd menu entry after <b>Open</b>:

	<br/><br/><img src="Images/GUI_Windows_Example_Files_Edit.png" alt="Windows Open in Explorer"><br/>

	<br><br>
	The Microsoft editor will open and show the source code:
	+++,
    "Examples 01:"::
#!/usr/local/bin/b4p -x

// The statement in the 1st row applies to UNIX/Linux/MacOS only and is called a "Shebang".
// It specifies the language interpreter to use when started as an executable file.
// You can delete this line it if you plan to use B4P under Windows only.


echo(Hello World);

	+++,
    "Description 02:"::

	Close the editor.  You have two choices to run this program:
	* Double-click on the file "Hello World.b4p" using the left mouse button
	* Click the file "Hello World.b4p" with the right mouse button and choose the 1st menu entry <b>Open</b>.

    "Description 05:Starting B4P from Start Menu"::

	As a next step, you will learn how to start B4P directly without specifying a program file.
	In this case, it will look for the
	B4P program called "main.b4p" in the currently configured starting directory.  After the
	installation with the personal folder created, the directory <b>C:\Users\Your user name\Documents\Programs\B4P</b>
	the memorized starting directory.

	<br><br>

	You can change the starting directory to a different location by making a copy of <b>start B4P here.b4p</b>
	into a different directory and click on it to execute it.  Don't do it for this first example yet.

	<br><br>
	In the starting directory, B4P will look for the file 'main.b4p'.  If the file is available, then you
	will be asked whether to start that one or enter interactive mode instead.  Start the program.
	In case no 'main.b4p' is available, then B4P enters into interactive mode directly.

	<br><br>
	Start B4P using the start menu:

	<br/><img src="Images/GUI_Windows_Start_Menu.png" alt="Windows Start Menu"><br/>
