    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The following pages describe the installation procdure for the following target systems:

	* Windows (at least Windows 7)
	* Linux
	* MacOS

	Since the installation script has also been implemented in B4P, the installation procedure 
	appears a bit differently as compared to installing other software, however you will be
	experiencing a very fast installation procedure.

    "Feature Names":		[ "Updates and Upgrades" ],
    "Description 01:Update Installations"::

	B4P update installations using the same version of the B4P interpreter can be carried out by starting
	the same installation program.  Typical cases are repeating installations with different settings such as changed
	locale settings, or including an approved license in order to lift the applicable restrictions.

	<br><br>

	Start the same installation program (setup) as you have done with the intial installation and choose 
	"M" for local machine (or "U" user specific installation, Windows only) to redo the installation.
	The installer will automatically check for any existing installations including the following:

	* User-specific settings (for example it contains the chosen browser for the 'docs' function)
	* Locale settings (country and language settings)
	* License information (<b>B4P License File.json</b>)
	* User-specific initialization program(<b>My B4P Init.b4p</b>).

	The following example shows an update installation:

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	Under Windwos, all registry configurations will be retracted, for example assigning the ".b4p" file type to the B4P
	icon and removing B4P in the path environment variable.

	<br><br>

	Your personal B4P program folder created by the installer will not be removed.
