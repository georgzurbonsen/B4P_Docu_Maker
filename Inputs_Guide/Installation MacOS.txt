	+++,



"Description 09:Optional: Create a personal folder"::
	This is a very useful feature and is highly recommended to create this. 
	A directory called <b>Users\<i>Your user name</i>\b4p</b> will be created 
	and contain the following files: 
	* hello world.b4p
	* interacctive b4p
	* main.b4p
	* start B4P here.b4p
	* B4P Reference Manual.b4p

	In the case you are re-installing B4P and the folder already exists, 
	only the missing files will be overwritten.  
	
	+++,

"Examples 09:"::
	Do you want to create a personal B4P program folder ?  Y
    Creating directory: /Users/rafael/b4p
    If directory or files already exist, then existing files
    will not be overwritten.

    Done creating this directory.
    When you start B4P without file specified, 'Main.b4p' in this directory will be started.

    Highly advisable to restart your machine so all configuration settings for this installation are in effect.


Done - Press ENTER key

"Description 10:Concluding the Installation"::
	Press [Enter] to close the installer.  Now you are ready to start working with B4P.

"MacOS - Getting Started" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "MacOS Getting Started" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	B4P under MacOS is operational immediately after installation.  No system reboot is necessary.
	<br><br>
	First, using the terminal application change directory from the home directory 
	to the B4P directory at <b>/home/username/b4p</b>  using the 'cd' command.
	<br>
	Then, list all the files in the B4P directory using the 'ls' command
    +++,

	
    "Examples 01:"::
	[~]$ cd b4p
	[b4p]$ ls
	'B4P Reference Manual.b4p'   interactive.b4p  'start B4P here.b4p'
	'hello world.b4p'            main.b4p
	[b4p]$
    +++,

    "Description 02:Try Hello World"::
	First, take a look at the B4P code in 'hello world.b4p' by opening this file in your code editor.
	+++,


    "Examples 02: Open B4P program 'hello world' in your code editor (Visual Studio Code) using the 'code' command"::
	[b4p]$ code hello world.b4p
	+++,


    "Output 02:"::
	#!/usr/local/bin/b4p

	// The statement in the 1st row applies to UNIX/Linux/MacOS only and is called a "Shebang".
	// It specifies the language interpreter to use when started as an executable file.
	// You can delete this line it if you plan to use B4P under Windows only.

	// Shebangs are ignored in Microsoft Windows environments.
	
	echo(Hello World);
	+++,


    "Description 03:"::
	Close the code editor. The following three commands do the same: Start b4p and run the B4P program "hello world.b4p".
	* <b>b4p "hello world.b4p"</b> starts B4P explicitly with the B4P program provided as command line parameter,
	* <b>./"hello world.b4p"</b> starts the B4P file like any other system executable program,
	* <b>./hello*</b>, wildcard symboles allowing you to specify a part of the file name which is unique in the current directory.
	+++,



    "Examples 03:"::
	[b4p]$ ./hello*
	+++,

	+++,




    "Description 05:Starting B4P Without a Specified B4P Program"::

	You can also start B4P without specifying a B4P program file name.  In this case, it will look for the
	B4P program called "main.b4p" in the personal B4P directory  home/username/b4p.

	<br><br>

	You can change the starting directory to a different location by making a copy of <b>start B4P here.b4p</b>
	into a different directory and execute this one.  Don't do it for this first example yet.

	<br><br>
	In the starting directory, B4P will look for the file 'main.b4p'.  If the file is available, then you
	will be asked whether to start that one or enter interactive mode instead.  Start the program.
	In case no 'main.b4p' is available, then B4P enters into interactive mode directly.

	+++,

    "Examples 05:"::
	[b4p]$ b4p

	to open the on-line manual  
	* <b>"./B4P Reference Manual.b4p"</b> (Command fully spelled out)
	* <b>./*Manual*</b> (More convenient if you use wildcard symbols)
	* Inside B4P running in interactive mode, you can type <b>docs</b> to access the documentation, too.
	At the first time, you will be asked for the browser you wish (currently Chrome and Firefox are supported),
	following this the on-line documentation opens up.
