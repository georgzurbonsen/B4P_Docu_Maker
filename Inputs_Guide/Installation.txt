	The following pages describe the installation procdure for the following target systems:

	* Windows (at least Windows 7)
	* Linux
	* MacOS

	Since the installation script has also been implemented in B4P, the installation procedure 
	appears a bit differently as compared to installing other software, however you will be
	experiencing a very fast installation procedure.  The installation script is open source
	(see 'setup.txt'), but is protected from doing modifications on it and attempting to run it.

    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The following pages provide step-by-step instructions for downloading and installing
	the B4P applications for Windows.

	<br><br>
	<b>System requirements:</b>
	* Personal computer running Windows 7.0 or higher
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. admin rights on your local machine)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

	<b>Special software requirements:</b>
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Install 7-ZIP, a free of charge compression and decompression tool.  This tool is needed because standard Windows installations provide no command level ZIP tool.  \
	  Without this tool, some functions, including file compression/decompression functions and loading Excel files, will not work.

	Click on the following link: <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank"><b>https://www.7-zip.org/download.html</b></a> to download aind install 7-ZIP.

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and usage of decimal points or decimal commas for numbers.

	* interacctive b4p
	* Main.b4p
	* Start B4P here.b4p

	In case the folder is already existing, then only the missing files will be overwritten.  This is the case if you redo the installation.

    "Examples 01:"::
#!/usr/local/bin/b4p

// The statement in the 1st row applies to UNIX/Linux/MacOS only and is called a "Shebang".
// It specifies the language interpreter to use when started as an executable file.
// You can delete this line it if you plan to use B4P under Windows only.
