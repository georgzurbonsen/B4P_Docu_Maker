"Linux - Prerequisites" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux Prerequisites" ],

    "Description 01:System Requierments"::
	* Personal computer running LINUX using a common distribution (e.g. Ubuntu)
	* 64 bit CPU (we are not supporting legacy platforms)
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. allowed to run commands with 'sudo' in front)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

    "Description 02:Software Requirements"::
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Ensure that the Linux command <b>wget</b> is available.  If not, then install it according to Linux-specific procedures (e.g. using <b>apt-get install wget</b>, commands vary among different Linux distributions)
	* Ensure that the Linux command <b>zip</b> and <b>unzip</b> are available.  If not, then install it according to Linux-specific procedures (e.g. using <b>apt-get install zip unzip</b>, commands vary among different Linux distributions)
	* Web browser installed: Firefox or Google Chrome

"Linux - Download" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux Download" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	B4P for Linux can be downloaded by clicking on the following link:

	<br><br>

	( Placeholder for a link to download the file )

	<br><br>

	With the download carried out, you automatically agree to accept the __Terms and Conditions__ for use of the B4P interpreter and all
	asscociated files such as libraries.  The terms and conditions are binding at any time you are using B4P.

    "Description 02:Extracting the Files"::

	The downloaded file is either a compressed <b>.zip</b> or <b>.tar.gz</b> file.
	* Use <b>tar -xzvf B4P_*.tar.gz</b>, or
	* Use <b>unzip B4P_*.zip</b>
	to decompress the files. The asterisk symbol is a wildcard feature ana allows you to specify a unique part of the file name only, as long there is no 
	ambiguity with other files.

	<br><br>

	You should see the following files and directory in a new directory called <b>b4p installation</b>:

	=== 300, 700, noheader, bold_column_1
	b4p			| B4P interpreter.
	setup			| B4P installation program
	List of Locales.csv	| Contains locale-specific details (e.g. number and date formats, weekday and months in different language, etc.)
	lib\			| Directory containing B4P library files
	weblib\			| Directory containing Web-specific library features written in JavaScript.
	===
	<br>
	The contents in 'weblib' contain some CSS files and Javascript codes files which are provided by SpryMedia Ltd, Scottland, and are in use under the MIT license.


	<br><br>
	Included B4P programs:
	=== 300, 700, noheader, bold_column_1
	main.b4p			| A default B4P program which can start automatically if declared so
	interactive.b4p			| A 1-statement B4P program going to interactive mode directly
	B4P Reference Manual.b4p	| A 2-statement B4P program opening the online reference manual on a browser of choice.  A link to this file will be included in the start menu and added to the desktop if requested.
	hello world.b4p			| Self-explanatory
	start B4P here.b4p		| A 1-statement B4P program which sets current directoy as starting directory. If B4P is started without a B4P program file, then B4P \
					  will look in this directory for 'main.b4p'.  If not found, then it will go into interactive mode.
	My B4P Init.b4p			| A user-customizable B4P initialization file and template which will be copied into the user application directory and you.
	===	

	+++,
	"Description 03:Adjust File Mode Flags (Applicable only if .zip file chosen and extracted)"::

	If you have chosen to use the <b>... .tar.gz</b> file, then the mode flag settings (B4P files executable) are already preserved and you can skip the last step
	described below.

	<br><br>	
	However, if you have chosen to decompress the <b>... .zip</b> file, then you need to change the mode flags of selected files which include
	the executable program as well as all B4P program files included.  Use the following command for this: <b>chmod 755 b4p *.b4p setup </b>

	+++,
	"Examples 03:File mode: Enable ability to execute files with 'chmod' command"::
username@domain:~/b4p_installation$ ls
 b4p                         interactive.b4p        main.b4p              weblib
'B4P Reference Manual.b4p'   lib                    setup
'hello world.b4p'           'List of Locales.csv'  'start B4P here.b4p'
username@domain:~/b4p_installation$ chmod 755 b4p *.b4p setup

B4P - Installation Program
_______________________________________________________________________________

Version 8.00 Candidate (2020-11-08)
Copyright (C) 2012..2020 Georg zur Bonsen, all rights reserved.

B4P installation program is starting (Linux and MacOS platforms) ... 

1 >> Check the B4P privileges to run installation program ...


2 >> Installation program - Main Menu ...

     M :  Do Machine installation for all users
     D :  De-install B4P
     I :  Do Identification for acquiring a license
     E :  Exit installer without actions
Please select: 
	+++,
    "Description 02:"::
	Choice 'M' makes the installation visible for all users and puts the executable file into a subdirectory of <b>C:\Program Files\B4P</b>.  

	<br><br>
	The output shown below has been shortened in this documentation.  The installer will list all working steps and files processed.

	+++,
    "Examples 02:"::
3 >> Check that all required files are available for installation ...
...
4 >> Identify locations for the program files ...
...
5 >> Deleting B4P program and application data subdirectories (if existing) ...
...
6 >> Create new folders for B4P program ...
...
7 >> Copy all files to destination directory '/usr/local/etc/b4p ...
...
	+++,
    "Description 03:Select Country and Language Settings"::
	The B4P installaion program asks for both language and country.  This combination is a <i>locale</i> information which rules
	things like number and date format, currency symbols, month and weekday names in the specified language, etc.

	<br><br>

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and numbers may either make use of decimal points or commas.

	+++,
    "Examples 03:"::
8 >> Restore user and locale settings (if available) ...

	+++,
    "Description 05:Activating B4P with License File or in Demo Mode"::
	If you do not have a license file and you plan to use B4P for demonstration, evaluation and/or educational purposes,
	then press [Enter] to continue.  Otherwise, specify the full path an file name of the license file you have
	received in order to deactivate all restrictions.

	<br><br>
	<u>Hint</u>: Instead of typing the full path and file name: if you see the license file in an explorer file, copy the path
	from the address bar, paste it into the line, and then copy the file name (not the whole file) and paste it here, with a directory separator inbetween.
	B4P will verify if the file is available and the license code is valid.  If not, the query will be repeated.

	+++,

    "Examples 05:"::

9 >> Program Licensing ...

License activation ...

    Specify the license file (typically called 'B4P Licsense File.json'), or
    press [Enter] to skip this and run B4P in demo mode with some restrictions.
    Enter path + file name or press [Enter] to skip
    -->     
    Nothing entered.  B4P will be activated in demo mode.

>>  Congratulations! Installation has been completed.

	+++,
    "Description 06:Option - Create a personal folder"::
	This is a nice feature especially for beginners. Highly recommended.
	A directory called <b>C:\Users\<i>Your user name</i>\Documents\Programs\B4P</b> will be created
	and contains the following files: 
	* hello world.b4p
	* interacctive b4p
	* main.b4p
	* start B4P here.b4p
	* B4P Reference Manual.b4p

	In case the folder is already existing, then only the missing files will be overwritten.  This is the case if you redo the installation.

	+++,
    "Examples 06:"::
    Do you want to create a personal B4P program folder ?  Y
    Creating directory: /home/georg/b4p
    If directory or files already exist, then existing files
    will not be overwritten.

    Done creating this directory.
    When you start B4P without file specified, 'Main.b4p' in this directory will be started.


    Highly advisable to restart your machine so all configuration settings for this installation are in effect.


Done - Press ENTER key

    +++,
    "Description 07:Concluding the Installation"::
	Press [Enter] to close the installer.  Now you are ready to start working with B4P.

"Linux - Batch Installation" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux - Batch Installation" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The installation script can also be executed as a batch so all user interaction (keyboard or mouse input) during the
	the installation process is suppressed.  The automated installation process is made possible using __long options__ when
	starting the installation using a command typed interactively or executed from a batch file.

	<br><br>
	Example:  <b>sudo ./setup --choice=machine --locale=en-US</b><br>
	Required super user (administrator) privileges are enabled with the 'sudo' prefix.

	<br><br>
	The example above initiates a software installation for the local machine using the locale settings "en-US" (English /
	United States).  Using the long option '--choice' in the command will automatically treat the installation process
	as a batch process.  The other options can be used alone in order to skip individual queries, for exmaple getting asked
	for locale settings

	<br><br>

	
	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Option				| Explanation
	--help				| Help text about the options will be shown on the console.  No installation will be initiated, even if other options are provided.
	--choice=machine<br>\
	--choice=deinstall<br>\
	--choice=info<br>\
	--choice=exit<br>		| Do installation on local machine for all users<br>\
					  De-install B4P<br>\
					  Provide information for generating a license<br>\
					  Exit installation program without any actions<br>\
					  The option '--choice' will ensure that the whole installation process is suitable for batch processing.
	--keep-user-settings		| The user settings from the previous installation (e.g. prompt) will be kept.
	--keep-my-init			| Keep own 'My B4P Init.b4p' file which can carry out user-specific initialization sequences
	--keep-my-themes		| Keep own 'B4P Style Themes.xlsx' file and do not use the newest one provided in the installation.
	--create-personal-folder	| Create a personal folder for own programs.
	--license=keep<br>\
	--license=new<br>\
	--license=no<br>\
	--license="<i>Lic. File Name.json</i>"	| Keep the existing license from the previous installation, if applicable <br>\
					  Use the new license file as provided in the installation directory (B4P License File.json)<br>\
					  Do not apply the license.  B4P shall run in demo mode only<br>\
					  Use specified path and file name (.json) containing the license information.
	--locale=keep<br>\
	--locale=xx_YY			| Keep the existing locale settings from the previous installation<br>\
					  Specify the combination of ISO 2-character language and country code.  The locale will be accepted if supported \
					  in the file "List of Locales.csv".  For a first-time batch installation on a new target, the local must be specified. <br>\
					  <u>Note:</u> Use the locale settings as used by Excel since you want to align on number formats, date formats and list separators.
	===	

	When the installer is finalizing, then it will pause for 3 seconds, giving users the chance to see the last info shown, in case the console
	window closes automatically after installation.
