"Linux - Prerequisites" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux Prerequisites" ],

    "Description 01:System Requierments"::
	* Personal computer running LINUX using a common distribution (e.g. Ubuntu)
	* 64 bit CPU (we are not supporting legacy platforms)
	* You have elevated privileges to do installations (e.g. allowed to run commands with 'sudo' in front)
	* Min 2 GB, but more memory is stronly recommended espeically when working with large data
	* B4P requires less than 20 MB disk space
	* Internet connectivity is required to access documentation, but not during normal program execution

    "Description 02:Software Requirements"::
	* A standard editor is sufficient for developing the code.  Optionally, install a more fancy text editor program of choice to do the coding.  I strongly recommend an editor supporting UNICODE.
	* Ensure that the Linux command <b>wget</b> is available.  If not, then install it according to Linux-specific procedures (e.g. using <b>apt-get install wget</b>, commands vary among different Linux distributions)
	* Ensure that the Linux command <b>zip</b> and <b>unzip</b> are available.  If not, then install it according to Linux-specific procedures (e.g. using <b>apt-get install zip unzip</b>, commands vary among different Linux distributions)
	* Web browser installed: Firefox or Google Chrome

	<br><br>
	Continue with __Linux Download__.

"Linux - Download" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux Download" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	B4P for Linux can be downloaded by clicking on the following link:

	<br><br>
	<a href="https://github.com/georgzurbonsen/b4p-download" target="_blank"><b>https://github.com/georgzurbonsen/b4p-download</b></a>

	<br><br>

	With the download carried out, you automatically agree to accept the __Terms and Conditions__ for use of the B4P interpreter and all
	asscociated files such as libraries.  The terms and conditions are binding at any time you are using B4P.

    "Description 02:Extracting the Files"::

	The downloaded file is either a compressed <b>.zip</b> or <b>.tar.gz</b> file.
	* Use <b>tar -xzvf B4P_*.tar.gz</b>, or
	* Use <b>unzip B4P_*.zip</b>
	to decompress the files. The asterisk symbol is a wildcard feature ana allows you to specify a unique part of the file name only, as long there is no 
	ambiguity with other files.

	<br><br>

	You should see the following files and directory in a new directory called <b>b4p installation</b>:

	=== 300, 700, noheader, bold_column_1
	b4p			| B4P interpreter.
	setup			| B4P installation program
	List of Locales.csv	| Contains locale-specific details (e.g. number and date formats, weekday and months in different language, etc.)
	lib\			| Directory containing B4P library files
	weblib\			| Directory containing Web-specific library features written in JavaScript.
	===
	<br>
	The contents in 'weblib' contain some CSS files and Javascript codes files which are provided by SpryMedia Ltd, Scottland, and are in use under the MIT license.


	<br><br>
	Included B4P programs:
	=== 300, 700, noheader, bold_column_1
	main.b4p			| A default B4P program which can start automatically if declared so
	interactive.b4p			| A 1-statement B4P program going to interactive mode directly
	B4P Reference Manual.b4p	| A 2-statement B4P program opening the online reference manual on a browser of choice.  A link to this file will be included in the start menu and added to the desktop if requested.
	hello world.b4p			| Self-explanatory
	start B4P here.b4p		| A 1-statement B4P program which sets current directoy as starting directory. If B4P is started without a B4P program file, then B4P \
					  will look in this directory for 'main.b4p'.  If not found, then it will go into interactive mode.
	My B4P Init.b4p			| A user-customizable B4P initialization file and template which will be copied into the user application directory and you.
	Tetris.b4p			| A well-known game coded in B4P
	===	

	+++,
	"Description 03:Adjust File Mode Flags (Applicable only if .zip file chosen and extracted)"::

	If you have chosen to use the <b>... .tar.gz</b> file, then the mode flag settings (B4P files executable) are already preserved and you can skip the last step
	described below.

	<br><br>	
	However, if you have chosen to decompress the <b>... .zip</b> file, then you need to change the mode flags of selected files which include
	the executable program as well as all B4P program files included.  Use the following command for this: <b>chmod 755 b4p *.b4p setup </b>

	+++,
	"Examples 03:File mode: Enable ability to execute files with 'chmod' command"::
username@domain:~/b4p_installation$ ls
 b4p                         interactive.b4p        main.b4p              weblib
'B4P Reference Manual.b4p'   lib                    setup
'hello world.b4p'           'List of Locales.csv'  'start B4P here.b4p'
username@domain:~/b4p_installation$ chmod 755 b4p *.b4p setup

	+++,
    "Description 03:Select Country and Language Settings"::
	The B4P installaion program asks for both language and country.  This combination is a <i>locale</i> information which rules
	things like number and date format, currency symbols, month and weekday names in the specified language, etc.

	<br><br>

	In order to avoid any trouble with your Microsoft Excel installation, I advise you to use the same country and language settings as
	configured for Excel so the CSV file format is compatible and not simply a choice you do personally favor.  Depending on the settings, 
	the CSV files may either use commas or semicolons as separators (In excel, take a look at a formula containing a function with 2 or 
	more parameters and check how the parameters are separated), and numbers may either make use of decimal points or commas.

	+++,
    "Examples 03:"::

9 >> Restore user settings (where available) ...

	* hello world.b4p
	* interacctive b4p
	* main.b4p
	* start B4P here.b4p
	* B4P Reference Manual.b4p

	In case the folder is already existing, then only the missing files will be overwritten.  This is the case if you redo the installation.

	+++,
    "Examples 05:"::


11 >> Opion: Creating a personal folder ...


    Do you want to create a personal B4P program folder ?  

   Creating directory: /home/georg/b4p
    If directory or files already exist, then existing files
    will not be overwritten.

    Done creating this directory.

"Linux - Batch Installation" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Linux - Batch Installation" ],
    "Description 01:Introduction"::

	The installation script can also be executed as a batch so all user interaction (keyboard or mouse input) during the
	the installation process is suppressed.  The automated installation process is made possible using __long options__ when
	starting the installation using a command typed interactively or executed from a batch file.

	<br><br>
	Example:  <b>sudo ./setup --choice=machine --locale=en-US</b><br>
	Required super user (administrator) privileges are enabled with the 'sudo' prefix.

	<br><br>
	The example above initiates a software installation for the local machine using the locale settings "en-US" (English /
	United States).  Using the long option '--choice' in the command will automatically treat the installation process
	as a batch process.  The other options can be used alone in order to skip individual queries, for exmaple getting asked
	for locale settings

	<br><br>

	
	=== 300, 700, bold_column_1
	Option				| Explanation
	--help				| Help text about the options will be shown on the console.  No installation will be initiated, even if other options are provided.
	--choice=machine<br>\
	--choice=deinstall<br>\
	--choice=info<br>\
	--choice=exit<br>		| Do installation on local machine for all users<br>\
					  De-install B4P<br>\
					  Exit installation program without any actions<br>\
					  The option '--choice' will ensure that the whole installation process is suitable for batch processing.
	--keep-user-settings		| The user settings from the previous installation (e.g. prompt) will be kept.
	--keep-my-init			| Keep own 'My B4P Init.b4p' file which can carry out user-specific initialization sequences
	--keep-my-themes		| Keep own 'B4P Style Themes.xlsx' file and do not use the newest one provided in the installation.
	--create-personal-folder	| Create a personal folder for own programs.
	--locale=keep<br>\
	--locale=xx_YY			| Keep the existing locale settings from the previous installation<br>\
					  Specify the combination of ISO 2-character language and country code.  The locale will be accepted if supported \
					  in the file "List of Locales.csv".  For a first-time batch installation on a new target, the local must be specified. <br>\
					  <u>Note:</u> Use the locale settings as used by Excel since you want to align on number formats, date formats and list separators.
	===	

	When the installer is finalizing, then it will pause for 3 seconds, giving users the chance to see the last info shown, in case the console
	window closes automatically after installation.
