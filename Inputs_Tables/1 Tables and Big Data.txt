	<br><br>
	By experience, successful solutions have been provided already <b>during the first consultation</b> with colleagues who needed solutions for
	their data processing needs.  They originally expected a cost and time estimation and a project plan for the project in order to approve the 
	budget for hiring programmers or consultants, and all that ended up not necessary at all because a few lines of code solved the problem
	and a lot of money saved.
