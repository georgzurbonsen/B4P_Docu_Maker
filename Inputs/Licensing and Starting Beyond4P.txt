    "Description 01 Licensing Scheme"::

	Without possessing a license, B4P will start in a demo mode and exploit the full performance.  The demo mode is useful for evaluations,
	demo, education and doing small projects.  However, following restrictions apply:

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Table size restrictions when saving	| Tables can only be saved if the table contains not more than 300 rows and not more than 40 columns.
	Number of savings 			| During a running B4P session, at most 5 tables can be saved.  The number of tables (and not files) also applies when using the procedure <b>table save multiple</b> to save two or more tables in one file.
	===

	Table size restrictions do not apply while processing tables internally, i.e. you are able to load large amounts of data and do data processing and
	analysis, but need to condense your output accordingly inorder to meet the size limitations.
	<br/><br/>
	Individual licenses for one machine, a specific domain or site licenses will be provided on request.

  {
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "starting" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "installing","installation", "starting","launching" ],
    "Description 01 Installation"::
	A separate presentation is available which guides through the installation of B4P under Windows and Linux.
	+++,
    "Description 02 Starting B4P from Windows"::

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Start menu					| Click on the start menu and select "B4P".
	Desktop icon					| If activated during installation, then click on the desktop icon.
	Click on B4P ap (.b4p file)			| In a file explorer or on the desktop, double-click on a .b4p-file to run it directly.  Windows will automatically start B4P with that file when running .b4p files.
	Command line 					| Enter "B4P" alone or followed by B4P app file.  In Windows, the <b>Path</b> environment variable includes looking for B4P. Example: <b>B4P HelloWorld.b4p</b
	===
	+++,

    "Description 03 Starting B4P from Linux"::

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Command line	| Enter <b>/usr/local/bin/b4p</b>.  To start a specific B4P application sript, then add the file name as command line parameter.  Example: <b>/usr/local/bin/b4p HelloWorld.b4p</b>
	Shebang		| If the file contains <b>#!/usr/local/bin/b4p</b> in the 1st row, and the B4P file contains Linux-compliant line breaks (line feeds without carriage return symbols), then B4P will be started automatically as the interpreter when executing the specified file.  The file must be configured as executable, e.g. with the command <b>chmod 755 *.b4p</b>
	===
	+++,

    "Description 04 Starting B4P from MacOS"::

	The same rules apply as for Linux.
	+++,

    "Description 05 Command Line Arguments"::

	Additional information, for example file names, can be added as further command line arguments.  Inside the B4P app, the command line arguments are accessible by referencing the global variable <b>command line arguments[]</b> which is configured as an array of literals.
	+++,

    "Description 06 Starting Behvavior"::

	If B4P is started from the start menu, desktop icon or entered command without specifiying an application script, then B4P undertakes the following steps:

	=== 40, 860, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	1.	| Look in the current working directory for the file name "main.b4p".  If found, then B4P starts this application script.
	2.	| Look in the starting directory (a memorized directory name you can inspect and change with the __starting directory(__) function) for "main.b4p".  If found, then the current working directory will be changed to the that starting directory (unless command line option -d is used) and the "main.b4p" will be started.
	3.	| If "main.b4p" cannot be found at all, then interactive mode will be started.
	===

	If B4P is started with an application script, the following steps will be undertaken:

	=== 40, 860, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	1.	| The current working directory will be set to the directory where the application script is located (unless command line option -d is used)
	2.	| The application script will be started immediately.
	===


    "Description 07 Command Line Options (Switches)"::

	Following command line options influence B4P startup behavior. These options are not added to the global variable array <b>command line arguments[]</b>.

	=== 40, 960, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	-d	| Suppress changeing the current working directory to the directory where the B4P app is started.
	-i	| Start B4P and enter interactive mode immediately. You can execute any B4P statement as a command. In addition, you can inspect variables and execute operating system commands. You can start B4P apps by typing <b>start (filename.b4p)</b>.
	-w	| Suppress B4P welcome text. <br><u>Attention 1:</u> Also the license info text (e.g. demo mode only if no valid license exists) will be hidden.<br><u>Attention 2:</u> Important B4P library files (e.g. "Support Library") will not be loaded automatically.<br>The system variable <b>runtime settings[verbose]</b> is set to <b>quiet</b>. This feature is useful for batch scripts which shall run fast and not outputting unnecessary text.
	-x	| Skip the "<i>Press [Enter] to end the program</i>" before B4P is exiting.  Useful for running B4P apps from batch scripts.
	-I	| MacOS / Linux only: Starty B4P in installation mode where the welcoming text and loading library files are skipped.  Not recommended for normal applicaction use.
	===

	Invalid command line parameters will provide descriptive error messages and stop B4P.<br><br>
	Command line arguments may be freely ordered and specified as combined or individual parameters.  See below.

    "Examples 07"::
	b4p -wx myprogram.b4p	// All 5 variants are equivalent.
	b4p myprogram.b4p -wx
	b4p myprogram.b4p -xw
	b4p -w -x myprogram.b4p
	b4p myprogram.b4p -w -x
