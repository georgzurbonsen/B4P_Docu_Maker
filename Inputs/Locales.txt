    "Feature Names":		[ "Locales" ],
    "Keywords":			[ "list of Locales", "locale" ],
    "Description 01 Introduction"::

	Beyond4P is able to support different locales (regional and language specific settings) which are managed in 
	a file called "List of locales.csv".  This file comes along with the installation package and will be referenced automatically
	whenever locale information is needed to carry out a particular function, e.g. converting a __date__ to a __literal__.

	<br><br>
	The locale settings influence information processing such the following described below:

	* Region-specific number formats (choice of decimal and thousand separator symbols)
	* Date formats (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY as default)
	* Weekday and month names in different languages
	* Using the right list separator for loading and saving CSV files for interaction with Excel (some countries-specific installations use comma, others use semicolon)
	* Currency names and symbols

	+++,
    "Description 02 Specifying locales"::
	Locales typical comprise of a combination of abbreviated language name followed by country name with an underscore symbol inbetween, e.g. "de_CH" for
	<b>German language, Switzerland</b>.  You may also specifc country or language names only, however they create ambiguitiess with countries where more than
	one language is spoken (or better: supported, e.g. Canada), and languages which are spoken in several countries (e.g. English).

	<br><br>
	For all functions asking for <i>locale</i> parameters, you can specify the locale, the language or the country.  No case sensitvity applies, meaning that
	both "en_US" and "EN_us" are accepted, as well as "USA" and "usa".  If only the language or the country is chosen, then the first match applies.
	Therefore, make it a habit to specify locales precisely using the pair of abbreviations.

	<br><br>
	Special values:
	* none = Apply no locale specific context
	* local = Apply presently appliable settings, either set during program installation, or modified with __set locale(__) function call.


	+++,
    "Description 03 Functions asking for locales"::

	* __literal(__), __softquoted literal(__): 2nd function parameter
	* __set locale(__): 1st function parameter (must be a locale value, not country or language name alone=)
