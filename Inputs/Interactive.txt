    "Description 01 Interactive Mode"::

	Interactive mode allows you to run any Beyon4P command and expression interactively, start programs and inspect variables.  Additional commands, such as
	executing system commands, are also supported.  Following cases will activate interactive mode:

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	Command line option -i	| Starting Beyond4P with the command lien option <b>-i</b> will activate interactive mode immediately.
	Exception asserted | Most exceptions (e.g. parsing syntax and run-time errors) will start interactive mode so you can inspect the actual circumstances of the error, e.g. by looking at variables and table contents.
	Function 'interactive' called | Specify <b>interactive;</b> inside your program if execution should stop here so you can do some inspections or manipulations.  Type <b>return</b> to continue running that program.
	===

	In interactive mode, the default prompt <b>'&gt;&gt; '</b> will appear.  You are able to change the default prompt with the <b>prompt</b> function call.

	=== 240, 360, 400, noframe_1stcolbold
	Command type | Explanation | Examples
	Beyond4P statements | All Beyond4P assignments, procedure and function calls and transactions | echo ( Hello World ) <br/>a[] = 5; echo(a[])<br/> for (i[ ] = 1, i[ ] <= 3, i[ ]++) echo (i[ ])<br/> start(My program.b4p);<br/> include(Zip Library);<br/>exit;
	Beyond4P expressions | Start the command with an equal sign '=' followed by an expression to calculate.  The resulting value and type will be shown. | = 5+3 <br/>
	Special Beyond4P commands | start <b/> return | Starts a Beyond4P program <br/> Continues running the Beyond4P program at the next statement after the 'interactive' call.
	System commands | System commands as provided by the operating system must precede with a dollar sign '$' | $ dir (Windows) or $ ls (Linux) for directory listing<br/>cd subdirectory <br/>start excel.exe
	===

	<u>Note on changing drives and/or directories:</u> You can change the current directory of Beyond4P using the '$ cd' (or '$ chdir') command.  Since changing directory in a child process started with the system
	command has no effect on the calling process like Beyond4P running, Beyond4P is smart enough to capture 'cd' (and 'chdir') commands and change to the specified directory
	accordingly. Whenever Beyond4P captures a change drive or directory command, it will provide a response of success or failure.

	<br/><br/>
	Following restrictions apply where drive names and paths will not be captured:<br/>
	- Window sonly: Commands like '$ D:\' are supported to change drives.<br/>
	- If the command contains multiple commands and the change directory command is not the first one, then it will not be captured.  Example:  "$ dir ; cd ..".<br/>
	- Input redirection are also not captured, e.g. "cd < directory_nam.txt"<br/>
	- Change drive directory commands in started batch scripts (and Beyond4P scripts) will not be captured, too. e.g. "START change_dir.bat", or "Beyond4P change_dir.b4p".<br/>

    "Description 02 Recommended Procedure and Function Calls for Interactive Mode"::

	=== 240, 760, noframe_1stcolbold, noheader
	prompt (...)	| Customize the prompt.  The settings will be memorized.  Specify an expression as a literal which returns a literal.  Example: prompt( "working directory() + '>> '" )
	prompt ('')	| Reset customized propt to '>> '
	list variables  | List all variables
	list system variables | List all system variables
	list global variables | List all global variables
	list local variables | List all local variables
	list functions | List available functions
	explain functions | Explain avaialble functions
	inspect | Inspect a variable, inclding all member variables (arrays, structures)
	view | View a table in a browser or Excel.
