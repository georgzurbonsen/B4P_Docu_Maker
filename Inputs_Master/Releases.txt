    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Recent Releases" ],

    "Description 01:Overview"::
	The roots of B4P date back to 2007 when the first C/C++ object class library has been developed to process
	tables, but the solutions were still coded in C/C++.  The first version of the B4P language appeared in 2013,
	following a series of improvments and extensions aiming to solve any form of business and analytical problems
	involving big data.

	<br><br>
	The updates made in the most recent releases are summarized in the following subsections.

"Release 8.01" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Release 8.01" ],

    "Description 01:Overview"::

	<b>Release 8.01, issued 2021-02-21, "Plankalkül"</b><br>
	<i>Plankalkül (translated: planned calculation) is the oldest known high level language, introduced by Konrad Zuse in the 1940's.</i>

    "Description 02:Bugfixes"::

	* __exception(__) call with the function parameter <i>up in code hierarchy</i> greater than zero was showing the wrong context of local variables in __interactive mode__ invoked \
	  subsequently, instead of the local variables as indicated by that function parameter.
	* __table load excel file(__) tolerated lower-case filetypes (.xlsx, .xlsm), but not upper-case (.XLSX, .XLSM).  Now both lower- and upper-case letters are accepted.
	* B4P refused saving additional Excel files if the 1st excel file was saved without stylings applied. Resolved.
	* __table save excel file(__): Sheet names containing '<', '>' or '&' have been rejected by Excel. Resolved.
	* __table save excel file(__) and table save(__): Error message will be raised if 2 equally-named sheets are saved in one workbook file.  Resolved.
	* __table load excel file(__): Some excel files contain fields with multi-line contents where a sole carriage return character (without following line feed or just line feed)\
	  marks the begin of the next line.  These variants of line breaks were ignored before and this has been resolved.

    "Description 03:New Functions"::

	* __width(__) identifies the width of a string, i.e. maximum number of characters between two <i>new line</i> symbols.
	* __quantile(__) calculates the quantile of a series of values
	* __table style auto width(__) does automatic adjustment of column width before saving (applicable to HTML, Excel, but not CSV or text files)
	* __table style themes(__) provides a convenient 1-function-call to apply nice formatting on a tabel before saving
	* __local(__) is a control flow function forcing to create variables locally even if equally named global variables are already existing.
	* __regional(__) is a control flow function which enables access of the code in the called function to the local variables defined here.  See __regional variables__ for details.

    "Description 04:Improvements in Existing Functions"::
	* __table load excel file(__): Added option to the Excel formulas in an additional table


    "Description 05:New Language Features (e.g. syntax and semantics)"::

	Release 8.01 supports __regional variables__ which are actually __local variables__ made visible in the code of user functions called.  It is an alternative to passing numerous
	function parameters and without desire to define global variables as they cause unnecessary side effects.

	<br><br>

	Addition to __generic formatting attributes__: <b>borders</b> will cover the borders on all for sides in one: top border, bottom border, left border and right border.

	<br><br>
	Explicitly calling the function __translate style attributes for excel(__) before saving the Excel file is no longer needed.  This function will be called automatically when saving 
	Excel files.<br>
	<u>Note:</u> For Excel XML 2003 and HTML formats, the corresponding translate-functions need to be called first in order to use the applied style info.

    "Description 06:Performance Improvements"::

	* __table load excel file(__) and __table save excel file(__) are running significantly faster because time-critical codes have been implemented directly in the execution engine
	* Some overall performance improvements in assigning values to variables

    "Description 07:Depreciated and retired features"::

	Please use __exec(__) instead of <b>statements</b>(), as well as __calc(__) instead of <b>expression</b>().  The implemented functionality has not changed.

"Release 8.02" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Release 8.02" ],

    "Description 01:Overview"::

	<b>Release 8.02, issued 2021-04-18, "Édouard Albert Roche"</b><br>
	<i>French Mathematican, deceased 1883-04-18, developed the mathematical theoretic model how the Saturn rings were created.</i>

    "Description 02:Bugfixes"::

	* [table name: column, ''] did not match rows with blank entries if the row width is shorter than column position.  Has been fixed.
	* [table name: { column names, ... }] referring multiple column names in parameter sets was rejected when calculated for 2nd time.  Has been fixed.
	* Comparing parameter sets with __equal to__ (=) and __not equal to__ (<>) operators: Contents were accidentally compared with the same operator, resulting in \
	  unexpected results like <b>{a,'b,c'} = {a,'b,c'}</b> returning false, but <b>{a,'b,c'} == {a,'b,c'}</b> returning true because the softquoted literal 'b,c' \
	  is interpreted as <i>equals to b or c</i>.   This has been fixed, i.e. contents are compared with __strictly equal to__ approach.  The same applies for the <> operator \
	  on parameter sets.
	* __table copy table columns(__) and similar functions: Erroneous copying happening when rows in source table are shorter than column specified leads to crashes when accessing these columns afterwards. Has been fixed.
	* Empty blocks, e.g. <b>if (a[]=1) {}</b> have asserted syntax errors which are not.  Effective in this new release, empty blocks are allowed.

    "Description 03:New Functions"::

	* __fy(__) and __fq(__) to calculate fiscal years and quarters.
	* __table manipulate selected rows(__) added, works similar like __table manipulate(__), but on selected rows only.
	* __describe(__) describes the contents, e.g. character, word, line, paragraph, date, time, date time, integer, numeral, scientifc, white and blank.
	* __table describe(__) describe the contents of a table, using a combination of __describe(__) and looking up descriptions in a different table.
	* __copy(__) applies a value in multiple destinations which can be variabls and/or table entries.

    "Description 04:Improvements in Existing Functions"::

	* __table manipulate(__) and __table manipulate selected rows(__): 1 optional parameter added to decide whether to stop processing \
	  the remaining entries in the lookup table or not in case the corresponding statement has been executed.
	* __table load excel file(__) now supports loading Excel formulas into a 2nd table

    "Description 05:New Language Features (e.g. syntax and semantics)"::

	* __Multiline strings__ are supported where a string constant may contain multiple lines of text.

    "Description 06:Performance Improvements"::

	* Minor performance improvements when processing parameter sets (skipped and eliminated internal execution steps no longer needed).
	* Batch-mode installation implemented.

    "Description 07:Depreciated and retired features"::

	* See __Release 8.01__

	* __table lookup(__) family: Stabilization (eliminated a potential bug)
	* Release 8.02 induced an error in the function __table distribute(__) which prevented doing the work.  Has been fixed.
	* __table list(__) generates wrong output in some cases when table fields contain mulitple lines of data.  Has been fixed.
	* Loading HTML tables also loaded details on styles if &lt;STYLE&gt; tags including contents are inside table cells.  Has been fixed.

    "Description 03:New Functions"::

	* __table digest(__) function family: New variant of lookup and integration functionality
	* __table lookup with rules(__) (also ... digest, ... expand, ... integrate) introduced.
	* Additional help functions, e.g. __help keywords__, __help functions__, etc.  Recommended for interactive use
	* __height(__) returns number of rows a string contains
	* __clean(__) cleans a string by substituting exotic UNICODE line breaks and spaces into ANSI new line spaces (codes 10 and 32).
	* __table clean(__) caries cleanup work as described above and can also trim out unnecessary spaces and line breaks.

    "Description 04:Improvements in Existing Functions"::

	* __table lookup smart(__) (also ... digest, ... expand, ... integrate): Added option to specify B4P expression for more flexible comparisons
	* __substitute(__) and __replace(__): Single-character wildcard symbols are now supported if the matching string is not a hard quoted literal.

"Release 8.04" :
{
    "Documentation":		"General Description", // Required value
    "Feature Names":		[ "Release 8.04" ],

    "Description 01:Overview"::

	<b>Release 8.04, updated 2021-07-28, "The Big Myth"</b><br>
	<i>The Big Fact: Mountain in Central Switzerland (Grosser Mythen), elevation: 1,898 meters, 47 deg 01' 47" North, 8 deg 41' 19.7" East (695034/209499).</i>

    "Description 02:Bugfixes"::

	* Fixed an old syntax parsing bug addressing sequences where syntax errors have been raised on correct syntax. It affects following code sequence inside __switch(__) and __check(__) sequences.<br>\
	  <b>__case__ (...) __if__ (...) { ... } <br>\
	     __case__ (...) ... </b><br>\
	  In detail, the following valid __case__ statement has been rejected.
	* Fixed another old syntax parsing bug addressing sequence where syntax errors ahve been raised on correct syntax. It affects loops (all kind of loops) inside __if(__).<br>\
	  <b>__if__ (...) __while__ (...) { ... } <br>\
	     __else__ ... </b><br> \
	  In detail, the following __else__ keyword has been rejected.
	* If __exception(__) is called inside a user-defined procedure or function in oder to assert a user-defined exception and requesting a calling hierarchy of \
	  1 or higher in order to show the code context of the callign code, then you may need to type "exit" repeatedly to leave B4P when done inspecting.  Normally \
	  typing "exit" only once shall suffice.  This has been fixed.
	* The function __call(__) to call any B4P function by name required 2 parameters all time though the documentation also allows just 1 parameter. This has been fixed.
	* Function __table save excel file(__): Improper saving of certain formats and style (incl. column width, row height) if 2 or more sheets are saved in one file.


    "Description 03:New Functions"::

	None in this release.

    "Description 04:Improvements in Existing Functions"::

	* __table load(__) and __table save(__): If the file ends with '.xlsx', '.xlsm' or '.xlsb', then the user will be notified that this is the wrong function to \
	  load or save Excel files.  The error messsage advises to use __table load excel file(__) or __table save excel file(__) instead.
	* __table load excel file(__): You can load multiple sheets from one Excel file into multiple tables using one single function call.


    "Description 05:New Language Features (e.g. syntax and semantics)"::

	* No longer to explicitly call __include__(Style Library) in order to add style features to Excel files.  This library will be loaded in addition to \
	  the other standard libraries: Utility Library, Office Library, Zip Library and Support Library.
	* Calling functions like __translate style attributes for html(__) and __translate style attributes for excel xml 2003(__) explicitly before saving the \
	  table into a HTML or old Excel format is no longer needed.  These functions will be called automatically before saving, which is already the case with \
	  the new Excel format using __table save excel file(__).


    "Description 06:Performance Improvements"::

	See improvement on __table load excel file(__): Loading multiple sheets with one call is faster than calling this function repeatedly.

    "Description 07:Depreciated and retired features"::

	None in this release.

    "Description 06:Other new Features"::

	Interactive mode has been improved where better editing is supported, including accessing previous entered text and accessing the clipboard.
	As LINUX / MacOS have not advanced input features like in Windows, this improvement is particularly significant for those systems.

	<br><br>

	Error messages make use of text color for better clarity.

    "Description 07:Performance Improvements"::

	__table save excel file(__) runs significantly faster when saving large excel files.
